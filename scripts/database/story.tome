  & Losing one's own things is very irritating – a scarf of all things! A piece of fabric that long could not stay hidden... or so {{Lupin}} thought. The same thing had happened the week before, and the month prior. It excelled at the art of disappearance. Lupin claimed to have nothing to do with it getting lost. The lengthy fiend was sentient no doubt, and enjoyed eluding its master.

  & Lupin could never remember where things were. Worse yet, was that Lupin also liked to borrow things. All {{Verido}} borrowed from one another from time to time, if they saw something they liked in the house of another they would take it without asking, and that was okay. Objects had a way of making the rounds and somehow always ended up back where they'd started — that is, unless Lupin was the borrower. Many objects from homes around the village had never returned, everyone knew who was to blame for it and yet no one came to claim anything back, having found joy in having fewer things. Their dwellings as a result had become more spacious, more pleasant, but Lupin's clutter only worsened. The clutter had become a hazard. some of the village elders did worry, but after much thinking they too chose to ignore it. 

  & Lupin - like all others in the village of {{Volare}} - lived in a tall narrow house. The ground in Volare was never still and so the buildings were tall to allow more flexibility. With every motion the walls cracked without breaking, and the tops swayed dangerously from one side to the other. Lupin liked sleeping from a hammock on the ceiling, accessible by means of a narrow stairway. The hammock would never stop swinging, carried by the constant motion of the world. Overlooking the hammock was a gap in the ceiling, a window equipped with a heavy shutter — which could be drawn down in the event of a storm. With a clearing like this, Lupin could sleep with the stars. Those lights, unlike all earthly objects, were impossible to borrow. The young Verido liked to pretend though, fingers obscuring the edges and narrowing down into a pinch. 

  & On the lower floor was a small kitchen, a cramped area with a pantry, a fire bowl and a cold pot. The fire bowl, like many other objects in the house, was made out of molded carapace shavings. The bowl had left over ashes in it, left over from the last time Lupin had cooked a dinner of grilled {{looma roots}}. The cold pot had another pot inside it, with its outer wall completely covered in sand, in the innermost pot lay fresh {{teaweet}} berries. Then there was the pantry, two long poles stuck out of the ground with braided isilk baskets hanging between. The baskets were used to store dry ingredients, Lupin kept a variety of herbs and root vegetables in these, like Looma roots, {{bibiskiss}} and plumpkins. Secured by the two poles on the ground lay a box with empty sacks of flour. When {{Levi}} was here the sacks were full, every morning they'd make bread puddings and giant domed loaves together. Lupin had fond memories of that time, but this house no longer smelled of baked goods, not since {{Levi}} had died. Lupin's diet now consisted of tea and grilled root vegetables. 

  & Some bottles of tea were steeping outside right now, warmed by the sun. Momentarily forgetting about the scarf, Lupin stepped out and put a nose to a bottle of {{licky root}} tea, judged it to be ready and brought it inside. The drink was syrupy and sweet. The dark circular roots of the plant lay at the bottom of the bottle, heavy with liquid. {{licky root}} was grown right here in the village, Lupin walked to the base of Vol's nape everyday to harvest them. Few plants could thrive up here, the altitude did not permit much, although fungi and small garden herbs were plentiful. 

  & Lupin sighed when seeing the state of the place. The floor of the main room had many objects; pieces of unfinished projects, attempts at honing a skill - any skill. Lupin had tried to learn to knit, but the result was too horrid to wear. The knitted fiasco had instead become the head of a mop, which to this day had seen no action. 

  & Lupin had seen {{Levi}} knit many times, the motions were familiar but these dumb hands could not replicate them. Many skeins lay on the ground, grains of sand mixed into the fibers. This mess was a left over from the last time Lupin had left the overhead window open during a heavy sandstorm. 
  
  & All in the village had a skill, but this young Verido feared to possess none — that is, unless the art of cluttering spaces could be artful in some way. Lupin was short and possessed little body strength, but could beat anyone in a dumpling eating contest, again not an ability that could benefit anyone else in any way. This was the truth behind the compulsive borrowing, born out of Lupin's desire to discover a worthwhile passion.

  & "LOOK AT YOU LEW! All dressed up and fancy-like!" 

  & Lupin spun right around to look at who was there, it was {{Rosmus}}, a friend and resident of Volare. {{Rosmus}} was taller and older than Lupin, with hair standing on end, higher than anyone in the village. A single strand hung low, weighed down by a single blue bead.

  & "I am fancy aren't I?" Lupin was wearing traditional ceremonial wear, a set only worn on special occasions like on Green or Leaping days. The outfit was colorful and had many details and layers to it, Lupin had a necklace of blue thread cascading down over a bear chest, the lower half of the body was covered with a patterned knee-long cloth and superimposed with a woven mat. "I spent all of last night looking for each piece... now if only I could get my hands on that damned scarf."

  & "Your hair looks nice blue!" {{Rosmus}} said, impressed with Lupin's handiwork, "your face paint though is um. Well- it's um, it's unique is what it is!" 

  & It was customary for special events to dye both your hair and face blue, using the crushed pigments of the of the fruit of the {{looberry}} plant. "I ran out of looberries about halfway into it."

  & "It's fine, people will just assume you've forgotten to finish it, which is okay, people expect that from you so it's completely in character. Anyway! I got this for you! A gift!" The visitor was dressed in plain clothes, holding a basket of {{trumpet flower}} sprouts — the stems kept fresh by a layer of earth. "Thought we could hang around here and plant these, in a few months they'll start flowering and you know what that means! Thoughtful of me don't you think? No one else tends to your need for intoxicants like I do."

  & "Your need you mean, you're conscious for about 2 hours a day... it's like your part {{Durdle}}. Hey–Don't you know what today is?"

  & "Sure I do, but I'm not going and neither are you." {{Rosmus}} said.

  & Lupin laughed at these words. "I'm not gonna sit here with you waiting for the plants to grow."

  & "Why not? I also brought some {{kabacho}} to drink! It's been steeping for a year! It's going to be real strong." {{Rosmus}} held a bottle of red liquid, with a wrinkly fruit floating inside it. 

  & "They're expecting me Ros, the whole town is! As much as I'd like to just sit around and drink all day I've got to go! I don't have a choice, you know that."

  & "You DO have a choice." {{Rosmus}} corrected. "You think you don't, but you can do whatever you want! It's all up to you! Come on don't you think it'd be more fun to do this instead?"

  & "Ceremony's more important I think..."

  & "So they say..." {{Rosmus}} said, "why go at all? I mean, you already know you won't be named Voice so... why bother?"

  & "Tradition."

  & "Right. Don't you think it unfair though? To be part of a contest with a predetermined result? {{Mago}}'s family has always been Voice, since Volare's time and that's not about to change. When you think about it, there's really no point in you being there at all! If I were you, I'd stay here. Come on, give me a mug that I can fill."

  & "It's just like you to say something like that." Lupin said, busy upturning the place, lifting every book. Lupin did find other things thought to be lost, but these stayed in their spot, to be forgotten and rediscovered again at a later more convenient time. "I've got to be there. That's all. Don't ask me again."

  & {{Rosmus}}, lacking a mug, took a sip of kabacho from the bottle instead. "Oh—OH! SO strong. Wow! Oh gosh my lips are numb!" {{Rosmus}} struggled for a moment to finish a thought, having much trouble getting the lips and tongue to cooperate. "So... you're alright with pretending you can win this."

  & "I'm not pretending! AH–It doesn't matter! I'm fine with it is what I'm saying." Lupin moved to the other side of the room to peer behind a table. "AH! It's here! I've found it!" The long blue scarf had been hiding there this whole time, wedged between the table and the wall. Lupin put the scarf on, coiling it tight. "I wouldn't make a good Voice, {{Mago}}'s better than me in every way."

  & "Did you ever think that maybe you're always underperforming because you know you can't win? That whatever you do won't change the outcome, so you know... why try?" {{Rosmus}}'s lips had turned a bright red color then, another effect of the kabacho.

  & "I'll find something else I'm good at... eventually. I'll see it more clearly when this thing is over. I know it."

  & {{Rosmus}} set the kabacho on the ground, then found an amusing hat and decided to keep it. Ros then picked up a {{koutra}} from the floor and tried to play it. "Bit out of tune, won't be impressing anyone with an out of tune {{koutra}}."

  & "Yea. It did sound pretty terrible." Lupin said with a sigh, eyeing the stringed instrument. "Look. I've got to go." The Verido began to move toward the door, stepping in between objects to get to it, then came up to the bottle of {{kabacho}} and decided to take a sip. "For my nerves," Lupin said.

  & "Hey! What if you actually did become Voice? That would be something wouldn't it?" {{Rosmus}} yelled. "Imagine! If you were Voice you wouldn't be breaking anyone's ears anymore!"

  & Lupin gave {{Rosmus}} a mean look before breaking into a run, the town centre was near but the sun was high now, any moment now the ceremony would start.

  > <hr/>

  & {{Mago}} was standing before the {{Volare}} town hall, an imposing edifice on the lowermost area of the Ilk's nape. The town was more animated than usual, there were people everywhere, busy wrapping ribbons around poles and hanging wreaths on every door. Everyone waved at {{Mago}}, smiling and saying things like, {_"Good luck in there!"_} or, {_"You were born to do it!"_}

  & {{Mago}} wondered if they said these things to cousin Lupin too. {{Mago}} had pale sandy hair reaching just below the ears, heavy with decorative beads; a strong upper torso and legs, the result of much training; and was taller than many of the other villagers. {{Mago}} liked to climb, and did well enough in most sports, many envied the Verido's ability to do well in everything. But today, {{Mago}} appeared less confident than usual... the young Verido looked up at the Ilk's head, hands fidgeting with the ceremonial necklace.

  & "{{Mago}}!" {{Armyn}} called out, waving a hand to try and get {{Mago}}'s attention. {{Armyn}} was bound to a wheel-chair, a younger Verido was there to push the centenarian around, past the crowd that was gathering around the town hall. "{{Mago}}!" {{Armyn}} called again.

  & Their family had {_always_} been Voice. {{Armyn}} had retired a month ago after being Voice for hundreds of years, due to a fungi that decided to take up residence in this Verido's body. {{Armyn}} could no longer move unassisted, and as the fungi grew the more organs failed. The spores had begun to take hold of both the lungs, and the heart.

  & "Anyone in there?" {{Armyn}} said. "Answer me space child."

  & {{Mago}} groaned, "I don't have to say yes yes at every word! You know I'm listening mapa..."

  & "Yes you do, and no I don't know."

  & "I'm nervous okay, you know I am."

  & "Yes, but you forget that I went through the same with cousin {{Levi}}, and my mapa went through it too with cousin {{Laggra}}. I'm here, right now, telling you that you have nothing to worry about! Our family line is strong." {{Armyn}} smiled up at {{Mago}}, admiring the blue face paint that {{Mago}} had applied so perfectly. "It happened ages ago, but looking at you now, it's strange... like being on the wrong side of a mirror."

  & "Cousin {{Levi}} was really good, I heard the stories."

  & "Yes, that's true, but our town carer saw sickness in the young {{Levi}}. It shows in your skin, it can be read like letters in a book." {{Armyn}} paused, saddened at these words, but only for a moment. "Lupin is good but lazy at times, can't even tie a decent knot, which shows that you are more serious about the role and it's what matters most. I have to go, but I'll see you in there!" Saying, the Verido helper wheeled {{Armyn}} away, both disappeared into the town hall, passing under a banner with the words "Voice of Volare". 

  & A small child stood near the banner, trying to sound the words written on it in {{ilken}} – with little success. 

  & "That doesn't sound right at all." The sproutling whined.

  & {{Mago}} joined the child under the banner. "You almost got it you know! Watch me." Hands moved into place, cupping the mouth in the right way, then came a collection of whistles...

  % content/song.voiceofvolare.png

  & The sounds varied in pitch and rhythm, the sound of it was otherworldly, played at such high volume that if strangers, who knew nothing of the language, heard it they would think it belonged to a giant. {{Mago}} whistled it a second time, to make sure the child had heard it right. "See? Voice-of-Volare. You try it, watch out for the pitch on the vowels." 

  & Eyes wide, the child positioned both hands and lips in the same way, and tried again with much success. "Do you really talk to the Ilk?"

  & {{Mago}} smiled, "Not yet, but if I'm Voice then yes – we'll talk everyday!"

  & "WOW!" stars appeared in the young sprout's eyes, at the thought of {{Mago}} being able to converse with 'The Great Carrier'.

  & Volare villagers were setting up a small stage near the town hall, they would be playing music here tonight, songs in {{ilken}} by way of plucked instruments like the traditional {{donmol}}, or the humble {{koutra}}. {{Mago}} loved the sounds of these instruments, most younglings were raised with music at their lips and fingers. 

  & Lupin arrived then, taking {{Mago}}'s side. "Well! If it isn't the tongue wart of the Ilk!" 

  & {{Mago}} grabbed Lupin's left ear and twisted it with a pull. "Think that if i keep your ear like this for a week that it'll shrivel up and fall off?

  & "OW! OW! I'll tell everyone you tried to cripple me before the big reveal!"

  & "They'll think you did it to yourself, you do hurt yourself more often than anyone else in the village."

  & "I've been told I have assymetrical feet."

  & "Why are your lips red?" {{Mago}} said, releasing Lupin's ear.

  & "Oh never mind that-" Lupin said with a sly grin, while trying to get some feeling back in that pained ear, "hey is my ear bruising? It feels bruised"

  & "Why would it bruise? I barely squeezed it!" {{Mago}} noticed the scarf then. "OH WOW– you're wearing your freaky scarf!"

  & "It's not freaky. Long isn't freaky." Lupin protested.

  & "I love it. Coiled around like that makes it look like you have no neck."

  & "Yea if I take it off my head will drop to the floor."

  & "Why did {{Levi}} make it so damn long anyway?" {{Mago}} said.

  & Lupin shrugged. "In the end, {{Levi}} just kept adding lengths to it without stopping, saying I would need it long. Never really gave me a straight answer when I asked why. Can't imagine how long it would have been if I hadn't hidden those last skeins."

  & {{Mago}} laughed, relaxing for the first time in a week. A large crowd encircled them at the town hall then, the suns were about to set, it was time. Everyone around fell quiet, and watched as the doors leading inside the town hall swung open. Lupin gulped, even a funny-looking scarf wouldn't be enough to calm {{Mago}}'s nerves now, but even so, this youngling always knew what to say in such times…

  & "Let's go inside–OH Venerable Nose Hair of the Ilk!"

  & "Don't say that too loud!" {{Mago}} chuckled as both entered the building. The crowd cheered, waving flags of blue and shouting their names.

  > <hr/>

  & The town hall was a modest size, there were no mansions or grand palaces in this city, everyone lived as equals and this building was a reflection of this. The walls had murals painted on them, images of the Ilk as well as a depiction of their founder and great leader Volare. A beautiful embroided cloth covered the long table, at which sat all of the council members.

  & The two cousins now stood before a row of 6 elders, {{Armyn}} sat on the far left and couldn't resist a smile. The others they knew, Volare was a small city after all. The 6 Veridos were all nominated by the people and did not sit here idly, each had a profession. Ence, who sat next to {{Armyn}}, was a skilled builder, and had helped in maintaining all of the houses here in Volare; another two seats down, was a letterer, and would write their people's history so all could remember it. Everyone in this room was an expert in their field, a great asset, and together they formed this council

  & "Happy you could join us. Today, our {{Armyn}} is retiring from being Voice, after 300 years of service,"{{Ence}} said aloud, smiling at the two younglings. 

  & {{Armyn}}'s left hand went to lie flat against the heart, "I will miss being at the ear, but my body gave me clear signs that it's time to let someone else delight in this experience. I've learned much of the world through {{Vol}}, our Ilk. I've no doubt that the new Voice will do grand things. I will be preparing to leap from the Ilk's snout in the coming week, I will want to speak to each of you before I go, you, whom I love." Saying these last words, {{Armyn}}'s open hand turned into a fist. "I take this love with me to my death."

  & "We will all bear witness to it, a leap is a grand thing." Ence said, visibly moved by {{Armyn}}'s words.

  & Another elder spoke up then, {{Maliss}}, the head of the Volare nursery, "a grand thing indeed! A seed will be planted, and when grown, will be told stories of your accomplishments." 

  & {{Armyn}} smiled at this, as did {{Mago}}. Lupin remembered being proud on the day {{Levi}} leapt off the snout, all others witnessing the event were smiling.

  & "Balance in Volare has never been better, and it's all because of your work {{Maliss}}." Ence said.

  & "I've got {{Melanza}} to thank for this. If it were not for the {{Terin}}'s teachings we would not be here." {{Maliss}} said, reminding others that the work of another had ensured their survival here, on the Ilk. 

  & Ence nodded at these words. "You are right, we have many to thank for it. Let us thank them in song." The councillor began to whistle, and all others in the room chimed in. The song was a re-telling of the history of this city and of its founders. Lupin liked to hear of the moment when the 3 founders — Otora, Balandri and Volare — first encountered the Ilks, the three giants were gathered at the foot of a mountain, grazing. Their leader Volare stepped up first, sure-footed, bowing at the hoof of the Ilk they now know as Vol. The story was famous amongst the Volarians, but Lupin liked hearing it again, and again. 

  & The singing came to a full stop. All in the room quieted, and the councillor motioned for Lupin to continue the song in {{ilken}}. The candidates always performed the last chorus alone, as proof of their mastery of the language. Lupin did well enough, despite missing a few notes, while {{Mago}}'s performance was pitch perfect. There were other tests, which included recitations and improvised verses, again, {{Mago}} triumphed. Lupin's improvisations were noteworthy too, no one else could perform a verse as informative as the nutritional value of a looma root. Then, came the last trial, a reading of their family history. Every Verido's skin bore patterns, a series of lines and dots, etched in deep, like veins on a leaf. Few could read them, here in Volare there was {{Pumra}} and {{Rosmus}}.

  & "Disrobe please," Pumra said, standing up and approaching Lupin first. The counsellor was short, and had long wispy brows, it was hard to resist reaching forward to tie them up together in a bow; it was likely that {{Mago}} had that same thought, a smile danced on both of their mouths. Pumra's finger traced along Lupin’s body, following the blue lines. "My mind has lost none of its precision, but these hands do tremble a great deal more than I'd like," the elder said in a whisper, looking more sad than angry. "I can't bear the thought of this skill being lost to the world... how else will we know to read the names of those who haven't sprouted yet?"

  & "I'll speak to {{Rosmus}}," Lupin said.

  & Pumra was relieved to hear this, and gave a light nod to show thanks. The counsellor returned to reading, muttering names and words in a hushed voice for some time, and then the reading ended. “Lupin, {{Levi}}, Laggra & Lunav. Sproutlings of Volare, same {{klorea}} coursing through your veins. Very good." 

  & Then came {{Mago}}'s turn, Pumra followed the patterns, mumbling. The set of wrinkled hands then touched a patch of rough skin, a burn, the counsellor looked dismayed. “I cannot read you.” The finger lay on an old wound, carved there, on {{Mago}}'s backside. {{Armyn}} was distraught, recalling the event that caused it. Years ago, the Ilk stepped into a deep crevice - a rare occurrence. The violence of the motion made the city tremble. {{Armyn}}, a hot kettle in hand, lost control and the scalding liquid left a lasting mark on {{Mago}}. {{Mago}} knew what this meant, and began to sweat.

  & “You know my family, we’ve been at the Ilk’s ear for three generations!” {{Mago}} explained, red-faced. “What does it matter if you can't read it? I speak perfect {{ilken}}, and have done everything you've asked of me!”

  & The other councillors appeared saddened by these words, shaking their heads. 

  & {{Mago}} wanted to die. All present in the room knew the family, as did everyone else in the city. The Verido counsellors were people of great skill, but they were superstitious, and tradition was tradition, appointing someone with a muddy pattern, they said, would offend the Ilk. At these words, {{Mago}} froze. These words shocked Lupin too. {{Armyn}} sat with the other counsellors, silent, while the rest argued. The word "muddy" they repeated often, every mention of it hurt {{Mago}}. 

  & Then the council came to an agreement, but both candidates knew the outcome already. Pumra spoke up, “Lupin-" {{Mago}}'s eyes fell to the floor, avoiding {{Armyn}}'s gaze, "you will be the bridge between us and the Ilk.”

  & Both had undergone the same teachings, but there was never any doubt that {{Mago}} would get the role. "Can I refuse to be Voice?" Lupin wondered, "No. {{Mago}} would never think of being Voice now, not after what they said..." There was no way to fix this. The festivities were already beginning. Things were moving fast, counsellor Ence was outside, announcing the good news. As per tradition, a ceremonial wreath made of braided isilk hairs was placed upon Lupin's head.

  & Lupin wasn't happy, and could sense the same in {{Armyn}}. In an instant, a tiny defect robbed {{Mago}} of all purpose. To make matters worse, they'd called it "muddy". {{Mago}} felt terrible.

  & Pumra led Lupin outside to face the multitude, hands threw fistfuls of curled ribbons in the air and all began to sing. {{Rosmus}} stood in the crowd, still in plain clothes, a hand over the heart. Lupin yearned for a drink of kabacho then, to forget all this. Maybe {{Rosmus}} was right, staying home would have been better, for everyone. 

  & All in Volare chanted, repeating Lupin's name like a mantra. The next hour was a blur, a mess of people amassing close and saying kind things, the eldest of each family added a single bead to the wreath, after a while the weight of it was giving the Voice neck pains.

  & "You speak for us when you're up there, we trust in you. May your presence at the ear grant us many more years upon the Ilk's back," Pumra said, adding yet another bead to the wreath. 

  & These celebrations were overwhelming, but it would not last, it was tradition for the Voice to climb to the Ilk's ear during the day’s festivities. The people would sing, dance and play games during that time, and await Lupin’s return the next morning. Wreath and all, the Voice climbed up to the ear alone, pushing through the tall tangles of hair on the spine. 

  > <hr/>

  & After a long climb, the new Voice arrived at the ear, it was a calm day, no wind, all Lupin could hear was the faint noise of music of the happenings in Volare, this, and the sound of the Ilk's breathing. Even after being told many times what to do, or say to the Ilk, standing here now Lupin seemed to have forgotten it all. Before the Voice could say anything, the Ilk spoke. Lupin could hear wind circulating from within its body, and felt it coming up the throat before it pushed out of its mouth, creating a sound very much like a low horn. Paying close attention to the length and pitch of each sound, Lupin understood what Vol had said.

  & "No wind" the Voice said, smiling, lips twitching. "I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous."

  & Another rush of wind, Vol's cheeks filled with air. Lupin listened carefully once again, expecting The Great Carrier to say something of meaning, but what Vol did say... was this: "{{Armyn}} vomited the first time."

  & Lupin laughed, so hard that for a moment the Verido felt bad. "Sorry, that was rude wasn't it?". This, was their first ever conversation, all those other times the only practice was with {{Armyn}} and {{Levi}}. "I wrote a song for today."

  & Vol's ear twitched at these words, listening closely. Lupin smiled, and pulled out a tiny instrument, it looked like a comb with flexible prongs. The Voice began to play a song with it, the Ilk seemed to enjoy it, its ears twisted at every second note.

  & They continued speaking after that, the more time passed the comfortable Lupin became. The Ilk spoke little of itself, it gave infrequent notice of changes in the weather or the terrain. Lupin spent hours listening to the whistled conversations between it, and the others of its kin. The other Ilks were far away, but wind carried the sound over long distances. It was nice to think that one could always know where the others were, they could talk everyday and be a family still. There were two others in existence, the Ilk of Otora and the Ilk of Balandri, two cities with Veridos. 

  > <hr/>

  & The morning after, after the festivities were over, Lupin came down from the head and visited {{Mago}}'s house, but couldn't get past the front door. {{Armyn}} guarded it well. There was nothing to do, and besides, it was better to give {{Mago}} some time to think. Instead, the Voice went to visit {{Rosmus}}.

  & {{Rosmus}} was busy putting another pot together, grinding carapace shavings into a fine powder with a giant mortar and pestle. "Vol is well?"

  & Lupin nodded, "Yea. I'm not though. {{Mago}} has been avoiding me."

  & "{{Mago}} needs time, that's all."

  & "Did you know {{Mago}} had a burn?"

  & {{Rosmus}} did not look at Lupin, and continued to pulverise some more shavings, "No. It's silly isn't it? This whole thing? Muddy-pft! What nonsense. {{Mago}}'s lineage was clear as day." {{Rosmus}} mixed a handful of powder with a crushed water stone, and began to massage it into shape, gradually adding more water or more powder as needed. "You know, I'm thinking of becoming a traveling potter. I heard {{Finiku}} love Verido pottery!"

  & "You're leaving the Ilk? I thought you were learning how to do readings with Pumra? It's a dying art Ros, it'll die with you if you leave!"

  & "Land-dwellers name themselves, did you know this? Pattern reading, as it is now, has become a matter of supersition. Vol doesn't care about patterns or klorealines, we do. We rely on half-baked rituals because we are afraid."

  & "Afraid of what?" Lupin asked, but in truth, did not want to know the answer.

  & "That our future is not certain, and that your presence at the ear doesn't guarantee a thing," while talking, {{Rosmus}} had already shaped the ball into a recipient, and was about to start carving shapes onto the outer sides of the bowl, but decided instead to reach into a bag for an object, which was then placed onto Lupin's lap. "Here, I made you a tea cup." A braid of isilk was coiled around its handle, "You can tie it to your belt with it, carry it around, maybe have a cup at the ear. Tea is good for thinking."

  & "I already have a tea cup."

  & "Yea, I've seen it, this one is better." {{Rosmus}} grabbed the cup again, and set it atop Lupin's head, "it's a thinking cup. Forces you to look at the world, to question everything. If you need to have a long think, fill it with tea and set it atop your head. It works, you'll see."

  & Lupin did not believe this. Not at all. And wanted to hear more of the uncertainty of their future on the Ilk, but in truth this mind did not want to think of it. "I don't need a cup of tea on my head to think," the Verido said, removing the cup from its perch, "I'll look ridiculous."

  & {{Rosmus}} laughed, but said nothing else and continued to crush more powder - making other 'thinking tea cups' maybe. 

  > <hr/>

  & Everyday, Lupin climbed to the ear, the Verido would try a joke but the Ilk never seemed think them funny. This was a challenge that resulted in many sleepless nights, Lupin was busy, hard at work composing jokes suitable for an Ilk. It was possible that they did not have a sense of humour, although some years ago, {{Armyn}} had mentioned something Vol had said, something about a grain of sand and a mudbear at a snack bar. Ever since then, the cousins agonized over whether or not it was an attempt at a joke. Thinking about such times made Lupin miss {{Mago}}, both hadn't spoken in weeks, {{Armyn}}'s presence made it difficult.

  & "You'd best stop coming, we don't want to see anyone," {{Armyn}} said, dishevelled. Since the ceremony had ended, both had retreated inside their home and no one had seen them leave. The only person who had dared to visit, was Lupin.

  & "That can't be what {{Mago}} wants."

  & "I don't like what you're implying," {{Armyn}} said, eyes narrowing down, "you can't come here everyday."

  & "If you'd just let us talk, I'm sure I can help."

  & {{Armyn}} looked upset, "You saying I can't help my own child? A curse has befallen our family and you're making things worse with your accusations!" Their family had always been Voice, this incident with the burn was disastrous. {{Armyn}} felt responsible, but would not readily admit to it. "It's the Ilk," {{Armyn}} said through closed teeth, "It meant for us to fail. Don't you see? It made me harm my child! I will die with this pain in my flesh."

  & Lupin could have wept right there, {{Armyn}} was not well and it was likely {{Mago}} was worse. Was this the end of their friendship? They'd been playing together since they lost their baby leaves. Insisting further at this point would only cause them more harm, Lupin loved them and didn't want that, leaving was hard but necessary. The Voice thought it was a good time to go to the Ilk's ear again, Vol had centuries of experience, maybe it could offer some advice.

  & {{Mago}} had heard everything. It was true that {{Armyn}}'s paranoia did make things worse, "it's the Ilk's fault... it's the Ilk. It made me do it, I didn't mean to drop the kettle". They fed each other poison, one with this unending silence and the other with misguided accusations, this night ushered in a veil of unease in which many dark thoughts had time to take root. Every night, {{Mago}} had dreams, it was always the same.

  > <ul>
  > <li>{_"They were at the Ilk's ear, {{Mago}} had hands on Lupin’s shoulders, sharp nails digging in deep. Words sounded from {{Mago}}'s throat, but the voice was foreign and cruel.</li><br>
  > <li>"You asked the Ilk to burn me didn't you? It was you!"</li><br>
  > <li>The voice came from a dormant thing that had long festered inside this body, {{Mago}} smiled then, and pushed Lupin backwards and off the Ilk with surprising ease.
  > <li>The body hit the side of the Ilk's neck as it went down, the bones cracked with every contact.</li><br>
  > <li>"{*Crack, crick, crack!*}"</li><br>
  > <li>Lupin seemed to weigh a ton, there was crick-cracking all the way down, like the body was coming apart. All sounds had vanished from the world, all, but the <li>crick-cracking of Lupin's bones. </li><br>
  > <li>When the body hit the sand floor, it cracked into pieces, like a brittle piece of stone."_}</li>
  > </ul>

  & Each time {{Mago}} would wake, feeling nauseous and guilty, no amount of positive thinking could chase those horrible images away. Lupin was a friend, one {{Mago}} cared very much for, getting rid of this rage was more important than grieving, there was no telling how such thoughts could affect the mind. Already, there was an itch there, a dark sludgy patch that was hard at work assimilating {{Mago}}'s remaining good thoughts. No doubt {{Armyn}} too, had fallen prey to it. The only way to get rid of the sludgy patch, was to find Lupin, and to apologize for disappearing. {{Mago}} had been a bad friend. It was time to move on, there were plenty of things to do on the Ilk, in fact, Lupin had hoped to become a {*Hand of the Ilk*} after the ceremony.

  & "That's right, I could be {{Hand}}," {{Mago}} thought. "I could do this and be happy... yea. I definitely could."

  & {{Mago}} finally left the house the next day, but did not find Lupin home. There was a lot of wind on this day, wind rushed between the buildings, sounding like a long wailing cry, escaping from the mouth of a creature no mortal could appease. {{Mago}} gazed up at the Ilk's head, most of it already engulfed in a thick cloud of dust, and concluded that this is where Lupin was.

  & That morning there had been talk of a desert storm coming this way, people in the city closed their shutters and wrapped scarves around their faces - strong wind was dangerous sure, but breathing grains of sand was worse. {{Mago}} was determined to talk to Lupin. Upon arriving at the nape of the neck, the Verido tied one end of a braided {{isilk}} rope around the waist, and the other to a security line. This line ran along Vol's spine, people used it to make their way up there safely, {{The Hands}} made use of these safety lines too, they'd been tried and tested and were deemed safe. The Voice typically carried a device on their backs, an extendable crossbar frame attached to a large fabric canopy with four straps running from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. Falling off of the Ilk was a common occurence, but descendants of Volare were in short supply.

  & And so began the long, arduous climb to the head. The wind was stronger going up, but this wasn't {{Mago}}'s first climb in such conditions, and the line system was safe enough. The Verido pushed through angry tangles of Ilk hair, the central line ran right through it. While providing shelter, the hairs gave the climber something else to grab onto. No sand made it in here, though looking up one could see bits of grains whizzing by. 

  & Then finally, {{Mago}} pushed through the last section of hair, and arrived to the top of the head. Lupin stood next to the ear, although from here the ear looked like a giant fuzzy plant, dark on the outside and pink on the inside. Once in a while the ear would twist, the Voice caressed it gently, in an attempt to calm the creature. There was little shelter on the head, nothing to keep the sand from grinding you down, this is why all who came up here wore thick clothing. Lupin's head was wrapped in a scarf, and a cloak rested upon these shoulders, this of course did not rival the Ilk's physiological adaptations. The beast eyes were cloudy, a third eyelid was drawn across it and acted as a protective curtain. A lot of particles lay trapped in the beast's eyelashes too, they too did a good job of keeping the vision clear, all of those tiny specks looked like insects trapped in a web. Their thick coats insulate them from the intense heat radiated from desert sand, and their gait and wide feet help them to walk without sinking. 

  & The Voice was too busy scanning the horizon for disturbances to notice anyone else was there, {{Mago}} was waiting for the right time to step forward, but couldn't gather the courage to do it. Also, dark thoughts crept into this Verido's mind, how easy it would be to undo Lupin's tether, the wind would take care of the rest... but {{Mago}} chased the thought away, horrified. {_"What's wrong with me..."_}

  & Finally, their eyes met. Lupin's eyes showed through small openings in the blue scarf, a lot of the blue was speckled with yellow. {{Mago}} was anxious, as if Lupin knew about that dream, the one with the crick-cracking of bones. 

  & Then Lupin turned back to the wind, and moved a bit of scarf away to reveal the smile underneath, just this was enough for {{Mago}} to build up the confidence to make that dreaded, but necessary apology. “I'm sorry I didn't congratulate you, and that I... that I-"

  & "You should be Voice {{Mago}}, not me."

  & "Please don't say that."

  & "I mean it. The Ilk keeps correcting my {{ilken}}, it's embarassing."

  & {{Mago}} smirked at this, but did not feel worthy of Lupin's kindness.

  & "We're still friends right?" Lupin asked. 

  & They couldn't continue their conversation. The Ilk let out a groan, to warn them of an incoming gust. Both Verido braced themselves for impact, but the wind came fast and strong, sand swept Lupin up into the air. A flurry of yellow grain swallowed up the world. {{Mago}} stayed put, belly on the ground with hands holding onto the main security line. When the wind died enough to stand up again, {{Mago}} hurried and grabbed Lupin's tether. "Hold on!" But there was a problem, the line was too light, like there was no weight on the other end. 

  & A sense of dread overcame the Verido then, "this can't be real. It can't be. They'll blame me for it, they'll think I did it." {{Mago}} felt dizzy, and continued to pull, "this can't be real." Then came the end of the line, and no Lupin. Tears welled up in {{Mago}}'s eyes. "LUPIN!"

Bed of dust

  & Lupin could hear a scream – was it the wind? Or was it the sound of life leaving this body? If there could ever be such a thing. The sound was unbearable, a prolonged high-pitched cry that caused this heart great pain. This mind did fear death, but didn't think that it would part with the flesh in flight, contrary to what the elders in Volare believed.

  & Leaping from the Ilk's snout was common practice with the old and the sick. They believed that when you made the conscious decision to die and leapt, your consciousness would leave, causing your body to plummet to the ground, there would be no pain – the body did away with that too. All people in this world were grown, and so your body falling meant it was returning to whence it came, it wasn't an end, but a return to normality. Now, falling and afraid, Lupin knew why the Verido came up with this story, no one would jump if they knew the truth. There was nothing romantic about it. The frail, and disabled, only did it thinking that it would be a joyful and pain-free experience. 

  & A great sadness overcame this Verido then, thinking of everyone who leapt from the snout, {{Levi}} too, all were duped. As the wind scarred their flesh, and the ground crushed their bones, their pride would not be enough to stop their tears. Lupin wanted to cry too, but sand brushed the tears off as quickly as they came. Lupin didn't want it to end this way, to die afraid. The mind hurried, trying to find something good, something false even, anything to chase the fear away. 

  & "The Verido, like everyone else is grown. Yes, all grown, everyone grown," the mind was digging deep, looking for comfort within "-returning to the earth is good. The earth is good, so good. There is no pain there, just a return to normality – ah, yes, normality. I remember being grown, could not see or smell, but the vibrations, I could hear things like this. Waves through my flesh, and saying things to me – or was it singing? It was rhythmic, memorable, a lullaby? It may have been this, many parents sing to their young. I've never thought of this before, it was in my head, buried deep, so deep, what else is in here? Can I remember before being grown? Can I remember life as a seed, or life before that? I can't remember. There's only darkness. Darkness is bad isn't it? The absence of senses is bad, how can I know I exist without this? But wait, rocks exist, and they can't smell, see or feel. They are not happy, or sad, they just are. Maybe that's what it was like to be a seed, and before I was even made into that, and before a rock was a rock. I felt nothing then, and after I die, I will feel nothing. The others weren't wrong about that, it is a return to normality... it's okay to die. This is okay, I'm okay. Another seed will be planted, I will die, but another will live. I will live through the stories, ye-"

  & A great dark mass came and hit Lupin then. The Verido felt great pain, and then, nothing.

  > <hr/>

  > <ul>
  > <li>{_"Hello, hello."_} </li>
  > </ul>

  & With eyes closed, the Verido could feel sand amassing over the legs and torso. The desert was not wasting time burying this body, nothing would be left of it soon. 

  > <ul>
  > <li>{_"Below, below."_}</li>
  > </ul>

  & Bits of broken crossbars lay scattered in the sand. Small breaths escaped Lupin's mouth, but inside, the lungs longed for a rest.

  & {_"It’s time to let go, let go."_} They seemed to say. The bones and muscles agreed.

  & {_"It’s time."_} The skin, and the rest of the organs chimed in. All, but the brain, who refused to give in.

  & {_"Well now, that doesn't rhyme at all!"_} The brain said, {_–ah it doesn't matter, it's all nonsense anyway. No one is letting go! Not today.!_}. The brain said these things, ign{{Orin}}g the damage the body had suffered during the fall.

  & {_"But we're broken!"_} The left arm, and its corresponding muscles cried out in pain. But then, came a rush of adrenaline, and the body and mind stopped quarrelling and began to work in unison.

  & Lupin groaned, and pushed this aching body off the ground. The Verido sat there, refusing to lie back down, though for a moment, Lupin didn't think it worthwhile to be alive. Vol was gone, as was {{Mago}}, and everyone else in the village. 

  & "Oh no." 

  & The Verido's back found the sand floor again, the pain and desperation was too much. 

  & "It's over. I fell. I–it's over." 

  & Lupin expected to die when hitting the ground, this was far worse, and all too cruel. The body had been alone for some time, consciousness had left it, if only for a few hours. While it was gone, the body did not try to slither into the ground. The sandstorm had gone, and with it, the Ilk. The sky was clear, the two suns were perched high above, with no cover or water, it wouldn't take long to succumb to dehydration. 

  & {_"What will kill me first?"_} Lupin wondered, weeping at the thought of never seeing Volare again. No tears came, as if the body knew it couldn't spare the moisture. The skin felt tight, as if pulled in different directions, it felt dry too, and crisp, cooking under the two suns. There was nothing covering this Verido's face now, the scarf had gone in the fall, and there was no way to move any limb because of the pain. There would be no point to that though, why bother to do anything that would prolong this life? Lupin lay in a place few traveled, only ones on the backs of beasts or aboard vehicles could manage it, and it was dangerous to do even then. Not many waterlillies grew here, meaning there was no water, and therefore, no life, or chance of pulling through. 

  & {{Rosmus}} came to mind then. "Things are changing. Pft! Things are ending is more like it." 

  & While falling, Lupin had decided it was okay to die, but now it didn't feel okay, at all. When another storm came, this body would be buried in sand and no one would know of it, if someone walked over the mound they wouldn't know that there was a body there, a body with a story. Lupin would disappear forever.

  & {_"Let me tell you the story of Lupin, who liked books, jokes and looma roots! Oh what a story it is! Lupin became Voice, and then fell off the Ilk. The end."_}

  & {_"What a legacy."_} Lupin thought. Then this body became tired of thinking, so tired. Maybe it was time...

  &  to let go, to let go...

  > <ul>
  > <li>{_"The seeds, we sow, we sow."_}</li>
  > </ul>

  > <hr/>

  & Lupin awoke again to a pained body, and more sorrowful thoughts some hours later. Though, at this point, even the brain had too little energy and will to conjure up such thoughts. 

  > <ul>
  > <li>{_"The leaves, they grow, they grow."_}</ul>
  > </ul>

  & The song came easy, no effort required. It was a pleasant tune, the only thing tethering this mind to the earth.

  & The Verido's tired eyes opened then, for a last time, to see the world alight before the darkness took over. Lupin's cheek was flat on the sand, looking skyward was impossible, but then these eyes found something moving in the distance. 

  & {_"An Ilk? No. Smaller than an Ilk– but big. Very big."_}

  & The figure was coming this way – was this a trick of the desert? Maybe this was a side-effect of land sickness. The closer it came, the more details came into view. A rider, tall, sitting atop a furry beast. They appeared enormous from afar, and even more so up close. The immense rider disembarked and walked over, holding a blue scarf, it looked tiny there, lying between a set of thick digits. A pair of heavy knees touched the sand floor to be closer to Lupin, even when kneeling, the stranger's head towered high above, obscuring one of the two suns.

  & “Hello Lupin of Volare,” the rider said.

  & This being was a giant, with features most uncommon. Eyes like silver marbles, sharp facial contours, skin aglow, free of blemishes – an otherworldly creature. The hair was dark and kept short, some of the strands had grey in them. A yellow robe, like a flowing mass of sand, sat upon broad shoulders. It covered a set of dark-coloured garments. The robe, if standing on its own, could serve to shelter a fair-sized group of people. The most impressive detail, was the height of this being, thin, with proportions that could dwarf most. Now, those silver orbs stared at Lupin's broken body.

  & “How do you know my name?!” Lupin exclaimed in a raspy voice, startled by the stranger's words.

  & “It’s written on your face,” the rider replied with a soft smile. “I’m {{Uno}}, and I'm here to help." 

  & The Verido was drifting off to sleep, or toward something more permanent. {{Uno}} put a hand on the side of Lupin's head, "stay awake."

  & "Awake," Lupin mumbled. "Okay." 

  & "You will be okay." The giant said, in a commanding voice. "Look in the sky, {{Protus}} is out. Name all of the sky rocks that you know. Loud, so I can hear."

  & When Verido sproutlings were young, they'd often make a game of naming all of the known bodies in the sky, the names were difficult, so anyone who could remember them all was pronounced 'sky rock expert' and won the game. Most of these the sproutlings could not see with their naked eyes, it was information that had been passed down through word of mouth. No one knew who had named them, and if they were indeed up there. These names had been written into children's stories after that, making them popular. Protus was one of the moons, circling this planet, the only one in view now. {{Encela}} was another, but these two were the easy ones. Lupin knew a lot of the names, but this tired brain would have to work extra harder to remember them. "Baladavos–" 

  & A fear gripped the Verido then, or a fever-induced paranoia, was {{Uno}} here to carry this body into the next world? 

  & "Cencitris, Naxagorus–"

  & This giant could be the embodiment of death, or a hallucination – also fever-induced. There was a chance that the pain was so grand that it brought forth these visions, this was the best explanation, any rational person would come to this conclusion too. In a moment, these colourful visions of {{Uno}} and the beast would vanish from the world, and the darkness would–

  & "Liminik, Omoretus–"

  & They didn't vanish, and thinking about these sky rocks seemed to keep this mind occupied enough.

  & {{Uno}} began unfastening sheets of rolled fabric from the beast's back, all the while, humming a tune, a soothing song, that reverberated all the way down into Lupin's core. Somehow, it helped to quiet the pain. 

  & "Retna, Alpaninsis–"

  & {{Uno}} pulled out some long poles and began to put up a tent, all this done with surprising speed, as if they'd erected it a thousand times. A vibrant orange carpet was set on the ground inside it, and the rest of the gear unpacked. Out of a large bag, the stranger pulled out a collection of herbs, a small kettle, mugs, some grains, plates, a crate of waterstones, plus a bag-full of other items. 

  & Before long, {{Uno}} walked back over to Lupin, smiling. "You're only missing Aristollo."

  & "I've never won the sky rock game." 

  & "Everyone forgets Aristollo." {{Uno}} said.

  & {{Uno}} scooped the broken body up with ease, and carried it inside the tent, once there, came time to take for the wounds. Lupin's fear of {{Uno}} did not linger, evident strength aside, this being was ever-so-gentle. 

  > <hr/>

  & Lupin slept for a long while, {{Uno}} stayed close, always within an arm's reach. While the patient rested, the stranger was busy looking through a pile of ratty-looking books, a thick finger tracing along the words. The rest of the time, {{Uno}} was cooking and caring for Lupin's wounds, the giant did leave the tent every now and again, but not for long. A series of naps divided the Verido's days, at every wakeful moment {{Uno}} had a different book in hand, the pages were full of annotations, notes and scribbles. One of the books read: "A tale of 3", Lupin saw a drawing of Volare markings in one of its margins. When asked about it, all {{Uno}} said was that keeping records of what one sees was important. Before the interrogation could continue, there came a wave of fatigue, the body and the mind agreed that it was time for another rest.

  & “You look better,” {{Uno}} said one morning, offering a cup of lemoni lime tea.

  & Lupin nodded. “Yea. Part of me does anyway." The body was healing, but the mind needed some more time.

  & {{Uno}} understood this. "Everything heals, in time."

  & "You don't have anywhere to be? I feel bad to keep you here like this."

  & "It's no problem. Take as long as you like."

  & Now that they'd spent some time together, the other-worldly veil had dissipated. {{Uno}} was quiet, and did not always care to answer questions, but declined them politely always. There are things that Lupin wanted to know, to understand, but after a few weeks asking seemed pointless. It was hard to get the giant's attention most times, as if {{Uno}}'s mind was adrift up there. Lupin noticed after a while, that after reading books, {{Uno}} was more responsive, more present. Maybe that's why there were so many. 

  & Lupin had asked about this once. "Why do you carry so many books?"

  & "Times passes, and I forget. It's important not to forget," was all {{Uno}} had said.

  > <hr/>

  & Like every other morning they'd spent together, the giant served tea, a mixture of {{medililly}} and lemoni lime herbs. "Great for circulation," {{Uno}} would say. On this morning, {{Uno}} seemed especially aware of the surrounding environment, and after serving tea, silver eyes scanned the skies and the horizon, before stopping upon a mountain.

  & “Drink your tea. You need to be in good shape, especially if you are to climb a mountain," {{Uno}} said with a grin.

  & “A mountain?” Lupin didn't understand. The wounds had healed over, and some strength had returned, but climbing a mountain? This was not something one who suffered a great injury could do, not so soon.

  & “Yes. That one.” A long finger pointed to a tall mountain in the distance, a thick layer of clouds obscured it's upper half. “All the way to the top of it too.”

  & Had {{Uno}} lost all reason? It was hard to tell. The tall being spoke in such a calm and authoritative voice, it inspired confidence, a voice like that could not lie. If those silvery eyes found you, Lupin believed, they had the power to lull you into doing almost anything. It's like they could see past the layers of flesh and muscle, they had a direct line to your brain, and these words, were a reflection of your innermost thoughts and feelings. {{Uno}} would never make anyone do anything outside of their character though, nothing contrary to their desires. This being was the enabler, your inner-voice in the flesh. Everyone would agree that this mountain-climbing ordeal was crazy though. This Verido did think that {{Uno}} had everyone's best interest at heart, but this didn't make sense.
  
  & “Yea? Why would I do that.” With eyes now set on the mountain, Lupin wondered, had it always been there? The shape of it seemed familiar, yet no name came to mind. Vol had passed here many times, surely someone would have noticed it there. It was like it had always been invisible, that is, until {{Uno}} had mentioned it.
  
  & “It occurred to me that I haven’t presented you to my friend,” {{Uno}} said, walking out of the tent, "come!" Lupin felt too weak to stand, but {{Uno}} would hear nothing of it. “Come!” Very few possessed the strength to dismiss the words of a living god. Lupin groaned, and managed to stand up. These legs did not like to support the combined weight of a torso, limbs and a head, it was like trying to keep balance on a pair of wobbly stilts. Street performers could do it much better, with no sweat at their brow. Panicked hands grabbed onto anything they could, pulling the rest of the body over to the entrance of the tent. Those hands found a solid perch there, fingers locking around one of the poles holding up the tent, then came time to look for that friend {{Uno}} had mentioned.

  & {{Uno}} presented the friend at once, “Lupin, meet Kit.” Images of a tall rider sitting atop a beast resurfaced then, there had been someone else. Kit was a large big-eared creature - no doubt it could hear things small-eared folks could not. It had light-coloured fur, with what looked like spots of ink spattered about its body. Two darker spots sat over its eyes, giving an air of severity and general discontent.
  
  & "A {{hyroo}}? Thought those were extinct."

  & It occurred to Lupin then, that like the mountain with no name, {{Uno}} felt familiar somehow. There was a story, one that Pumra read to small children during town feasts, while the adults were busy. The story spoke of the tall ones, beings of great height, in the early days of the world, they towered above the clouds and spent much time admiring the passing comets and planets. They spent all their time looking upwards, but then one day, a comet landed at their feet and they averted their gaze ground-ward. Both began to watch the sandstorms form, and dissipate, then, came life. The comet had brought some foreign organisms, greenery, sprouting from the ground, the tall ones were completely absorbed by it, they watched it grow and spread. They spent so much time looking down with knees bent, that they began to shrink, and just like that, the tiny things of the world became more important than the big things. They became the first growers, and sowed life of their own across the desert, it was a famous story, they were "the guardians of the world". Lupin and {{Mago}} spent much time arguing over the texts, "Foolish stories, for fools like you!" {{Mago}} had said once. "If there was anyone that tall out there, we would have seen them." {{Mago}} wasn't wrong about that. Giants could not hide, why would anything that tall want to conceal itself anyway?

  & In the book, there had been sketches, one was of a tall being, thin with clear eyes and dark hair. "It's you" Lupin mumbled, eyes fixed on some distant, non-existing thing. The world was a very different sort of place now, there was so much to know and discover, but unlike the story suggested, Lupin did not think that they had created the world or its inhabitants, that was due to some other more complex process. The thought of ageless giants did raise some questions, not to mention it defied all logic. Speaking of logic, being an ageless giant, meant knowing the knowledge of centuries. {{Uno}} reading Verido markings did not seem so far-fetched now, it was not so difficult to imagine that someone long ago, had imparted this skill. 

  & Then, without warning, Lupin could not draw breath, it was like the air had vanished from the world. Nothing in the environment had changed, what this was, was awe. It was a rare thing, to be awestruck. Now, standing in front of this being, this living illogical thing, Lupin found breath again, and the laughs came, and they would not stop! Every organ ached with laughter, is this what Volare felt when first gazing upon the Ilk? A ridiculous and continuous stream of emotions, all contrary to each other? It was like one's own body was losing control! The brain, unable to produce the right sort of reaction, due to the grand and immense complexity of the scene, would flip all the switches on at once and hope for the best. "Ah, dry mouth," Lupin mumbled, yet another addition to the growing list of uncontrollable symptoms, of being awestruck.
  
  & "Tell me what you know of the early days of the world," the Verido said suddenly, eyes full of wonder.
  
  & When hearing those words, {{Uno}} laughed, Kit's ears perked up at the sound, and proceeded to nuzzle its master. The laughs died off, but {{Uno}}'s face still bore a large smile. This reaction did not confirm or deny it, the rest of the day, Lupin spent watching the ageless giant. The head did not reach the clouds, maybe it would again soon, maybe the happenings at ground level were of more interest? This was a pleasing thought, to think that such a being would rather live amongst the small. Lupin tried to imagine what other sort of people and creatures walked this world, it’s like {{Uno}} and Kit had awoken a newfound curiosity, a thirst for exploration and adventure. This Verido of Volare was entering a world thought to only exist in books, but those words, had taken solid shape. Falling off the Ilk wasn’t so terrible now, there was so much to do and see. The nameless mountain came to mind then.

  & "I’m going to climb you.” 

  & The next day, Lupin shared this intention with {{Uno}}, who smiled, and denied ever having introduced the idea in the first place.
  
  & “Good idea."

  > <hr/>
  
  & They spent a few more weeks together, until Lupin was at near full strength. {{Uno}} packed up the patterned carpet and fabric, the herbs and waterstones too. With everything packed onto Kit, they looked like true world travellers. Kit was strong and could stand to have all this stuff as well as the weight of a rider. Before they parted ways, {{Uno}} presented a copy of "The tale of 3" and handed it to Lupin. 

  & “For you,” the book was bound beautifully. "I transcribed it from an original, it's all true, all about your people. You may enjoy it." There was another gift too, but like the scarf, it already belonged to the Verido. The gift was Lupin's safety chute, the Verido had forgotten all about it, it had failed early on during the fall. The chute was taken apart and rolled up tight, it was now the size of a small loaf of bread. "Salvaged this for you, it was torn badly, I mended it. Fabric is hard to come by in these parts. You can use it for shelter." {{Uno}} also gave the 4 crossbars, these could also be used to give the shelter a proper shape.

  & “Thank you.” Lupin presented a gift too, {{Levi}}'s blue scarf, "My {{mapa}} did tell me I would need it long, maybe it's because it was meant to be yours." {{Uno}} accepted it, with many thanks said. It appeared tiny on {{Uno}}'s neck, the piece of fabric could not go a full two turns around it, so the giant wrapped it around once, and made a knot to hold it in place. This being took a liking to it straight away, large hands carefully rearranged the knot again, as if handling the petals of a flower. 

  & {{Uno}} climbed up on Kit’s back then, the motion of the giant's cape sent a flurry of sand flying around them. 

  & “Aristollo was named after an {{Iridi}}. Ask about it if you speak to one, it's a good story. It may help you remember it in the future.” The giant said this, right before Kit bounded up high and far into the horizon. 

  & Lupin waved at the illogical giant, the one who looked down and extracted that sad, broken, pile of a creature from its deathbed. A thought came to mind then too, perhaps this body chose to fall off Vol's back, heavy with ambition and eager to see the world. It was silly to think such things, this Verido knew better. Like {{Rosmus}} purposely chose to not be a pattern reader, Lupin fell, having chosen not to learn how to tie decent knots.

The mountain with no name

  & Lupin marched towards the mountain, carrying a bag plump with supplies. {{Uno}} gave ample food for the difficult journey ahead, the bag contained a dozen waterstones, these would need to be rationed because these shoulders could not carry more. The bag also contained 5 loaves of {{teaweet}} bread and some root vegetables.

  & The climb was difficult, there was no evident road or path to take. Lupin climbed over faces of jagged rock, feet and hands finding cracks and creases for support. The Verido stopped often to eat, sleep, or to watch the world below get smaller, and smaller. The mounting altitude was comforting, like being on the back of an Ilk. The undulating terrain, that looked unfamiliar at ground level, was easy to recognize from up here. Lupin had grown accustomed to a flyer's eye view of things, it would be hard to get used to looking at contructions from their base rather than from their uppermost part, doing this would reveal different details. 

  & {_"It will be nice to rediscover things and places in this way."_} Lupin thought. 

  & The climb continued, and a new perspective came to view, one exceeding the height of any being in existence. If one were a colossus, this scene would be most ordinary, with a flick of a finger, one could brush this and that dune away, or pinch a new one into existence. This imaginary behemoth, if it so desired, could even pocket the suns and moons. Then Lupin remembered, that there were people down there too, and that they would not appreciate it. One could not move a mountain on a whim, not without causing much distress. Such is the curse of the tall, blind to the misfortunes of the little. This was sad to think about, and so the giant game ended.

  & Many days into the climb, the environment began to change in big ways, thick wet clouds engulfed everything in sight. There was moisture in the air – a rare phenomena – Lupin took deep breaths of it. It was so thick, one could scoop it up and drink it from a mug. The low visibility made climbing troublesome, slowing one's pace was judicious, it wouldn’t take much to send you over the edge, a slip, or a rock breaking under your foot would do it. 

  & "One fall is plenty," the climber mumbled.

  & Many long days later, Lupin's hand reached up to find a grip, but this time, the hand touched greenery. It was a strange sensation. How can something feel cool and warm at the same time? Nails dug deep into the earth, like miniature grappling hooks. The Verido pulled, the stomach sliding onto wet grounds, flattening rows upon rows of blades of grass. Lupin rose, and gazed at the top of the mountain with no name. The summit was flat, more or less, and full of shrubbery and flowers, the smell was dizzying. Mesmerized at the sight of a bright purple flower, Lupin's knees met with the earth. The flower had massive petals, arranged in tight rows and bound together by a fuzzy yellow button, little droplets of mildew had accumulated on the surface of its petals. The droplets looked like jewels, but in a world of interminable desert, these were much more precious. It was difficult to believe this place existed. 

  & It’s here, that the Verido fell upon yet, another illogical creature.

  > <hr/>

  & Here, amongst the flowers and green wet leaves, a red-haired wonder lay in a bed of soft grass, asleep. It was a strange sight, this is the last thing one would expect to find on a mountain top. The wonder's pale chest rose and fell with every breath, pink lips curved into a smile. The red head of hair, created a hard contrast against skin so pale. All these things made for a most bizarre, yet wondrous sight. Veridos did dye their hair on occasion, but they were temporary, and never did produce a tone as rich as that. This creature was unlike all other races, with round ears and a complexion rivalling that of the moons. 

  & Lupin took a step back, keeping a line of tall grass between them, awakening to a stranger could be unpleasant. There was also the chance this person did not care for the company of others, why else would anyone venture up here? This would be a rather disappointing truth, coming up all this way to find it inhabited by a misanthrope. Lupin much preferred to think that this place was a refuge, a place of rest, or some sort of secret garden, and that no else but they knew of it. It was unlikely that anyone else would happen upon this place, when people left the safety of the city it was with purpose, not for sport. Your energy was a precious thing out here, over-exerting yourself in this heat could be deadly. Beads of sweat formed over Lupin's brow just thinking about it. The decision to come up here had been a careless one, whatever concerns the body had was not communicated to the brain before the climb, the legs and arms had been master of the body then, eager to prove they'd regained their former strength. It was that, or {{Uno}}'s not-so subtle persuasiveness. Was the ageless giant aware that the wonder lay here?

  & Maybe red lived here, but there was nothing around, no shelter, no fabric, no pots or table, not even a kettle! Around them, grew a ton of fresh herbs, pulsing, and caressing Lupin's arm, as if asking to be brewed. These nostrils could sense many different varieties, Lemone lime, Bibiskiss, Blue plovies and {{licky root}}s, to name a few. There were other smells, new smells, that the nose could perceive but no more, it was difficult to put words to them. 

  & Lupin was excited to be here, every passing moment revealed something new and amazing. How grand it would be if the wonder would open its eyes, and bequeath its secrets. Lupin tried to think then, what question was worth being asked first? 

  & "Where's your kettle?" Lupin thought this one funny. "What is this plant? And that one? What about this one? Yes. So many plants to ask about, maybe I can take some home." The Verido paused then, but there was no more room for grieving in this heart, there was no point to it. Life had changed in a really big way, it was better to make the best of it. 

  & With all this thinking and speculating, Lupin thought that a long time must have passed. Soon, Red would awaken, but the position of the sun relative to the moons said otherwise. Such is the curse of the impatient. It wasn't proper to disturb the sleep of another without good reason, Lupin would have to wait for a cue, a yawn, maybe a stretch or some wrinkling of the eyes – all signs known to precede waking. After much waiting the sleeper still lay there, not a yawn or hint of eye wrinkling. This Verido would have to find ways to pass the time.

  & The mountain was quiet, you could lay in green and watch the flowers undisturbed, doing this would occupy much of Lupin's time. There was an astonishing variety of plant life, some sat atop lanky stems with surprising balance, others had long green fingers, curved around bits of stone and neigh{{Bou}}ring grasses. Collections of flowers sprouted forth from the ground in fireworks of colour, then, there was the beautiful rosary of dew drops accumulating on everything. Even the wonder's skin bore many of these silvery jewels, the result of the occasional droplet of water slipping down the centre of a leaf, and dripping onto this living canvas. The torso had a complicated motif all over it, like thousands of little wet eyes, with a big breath, some of the droplets would slide off, leaving small wet trails behind. 

  > <hr/>

  & After many days, burdened by disquietude, Lupin decided to try and speak to the stranger. 

  & "AHEM," clearing the cobwebs from this throat was the first step, “he-hello?" A quiet voice was key, no sense in startling this person into wakefulness. No answer. The voice would have to be a bit louder. “Hello?” Again, no answer.

  & A fear gripped Lupin then, what if the wonder couldn't wake? What if this slumberer was stuck in a state of perpetual sleep? One could wait a few days longer to disprove this theory, or even some months more was not a problem. Dwindling supplies wasn't an issue, there was enough plants and water here to ensure good nutrition. Loneliness was a factor to consider, Veridos lived in groups and were seldom left on their own. Lupin imagined being here for years, this wonder-waking vigil seemingly unending. Could this be a trap? The allure of this mountain-top treasure would keep people here for ages until they were too fatigued to move, then, the plants would sprout from their ear holes and mouth and make a garden of their flesh. Lupin decided then that staying here forever was not an option, but leaving meant that the Verido would always wonder about the one asleep in the bed of grass.

  & "Just a few days longer, then I'll leave." 

  & A promise Lupin was sure to keep. This place was a wonder for the senses, a few more days would not be bothersome.

  & The air at the foot of the mountain was always thick with sand, but here, it was clear, and its perfume varied depending on the time of day. Maybe there was a flower guild, regulating smells using a timetable with slots allocated to each flower type. There was no need to cover one's nose with a scarf here, nor to cover skin from the harshness of the desert sun, Lupin had no need of a sweater either, it sat at the waist along with the vest that was underneath it. Lupin found a spot in the grass next to the wonder, and went to lie in it. Then sleep grabbed hold, and would not let go. The scent of the place and the softness of the bed of grass, a combination that could rob travel-worn visitors of their wakefulness with ease.

  > <ul>
  > <li>{_Lupin dreamt of a city erected on the back of a giant {{hyroo}}. The inhabitants had braided the fur on its back into elaborate houses, patches of fur had been cut away to make space for people to walk unhindered. The children would play hide-and-seek in the forest of hair, laughter all around. A hatter made elaborate hats from the fur, twisted into high spirals or matted into various geometric shapes. Life here was idyllic and peaceful, a thing of envy. Lupin was a {{hyroo}} whisperer and would go to the head to laugh and whoop with the {{hyroo}}, the whooping sound traveling far across the world._}</li><br>
  > <li> {_In this dream then, {{Mago}} arrived and spoke so loudly, that the force of it threw the city, along with all its inhabitants off the {{hyroo}}'s back. Again, the whisperer plummeted, but there was no end in sight. The {{hyroo}} leapt from one planet to the other, and bodies were adrift in space. This was not a fall, but a slow drift that would take you away into a sea of black, there were no stars here, the {{hyroo}} vanished in the distance. Shouting for help did nothing, the surrounding space was devoid of life. The suns had gone, this body did not feel the cold left it its absence, it was the same temperature as the surrounding air. Panicked, Lupin wept._}</li><br>
  > <li> {_"Not alone, not again." The voice fell on deaf ears, but the fear was too great._}</li><br>
  > <li> {_"Not again!"_}</li>
  > </ul>

  & Then a noise propelled the Verido back into existence, the whooping sound from the dream was real! With eyes open, looking up, Lupin saw a large figure passing through the thick layer of clouds above, it landed opposite of the bed of grass, landing without a sound and without disturbing any of the droplets on the leaves. The beast had large round ears, like Kit, in fact, it looked very much like Kit.

  & “K-kit?”

  & Sitting up, a cascade of mildew slid into the grass from Lupin's chest, and that fear of body invasion by plants returned, but these ear holes had no sprouts, the mouth and nostrils were also spared. How much time had passed? There was no way to know. Had the green garden acquired a new slumbering prisoner? Lupin knew how foolish this was. The glow of the suns through clouds was a poor sign of the passing of time over long periods. Perhaps the red wonder had arrived around the same time, and exhausted, had fallen here for a rest. 

  & The beast let out a laugh then, a high-pitched noise. It caused much of the droplets around to slide off their beds, this was definitely the sound heard in the dream. The beast was a {{hyroo}}, like Kit, it moved over to the sleeping one and went in for a good long lick. And then, there was a yawn, some wrinkling of the eyes followed by a stir! A soft smile formed, lips curving and carving a new shape for the cheeks, arms and legs stretching out, then, eyelids slid open, pale hands found the tip of the beast’s snout, and moved to caress its large head. All the while, the beast kept its eyes on Lupin, the red wonder followed its gaze and stopped upon the stranger. Red eyes had found the intruder, unblinking, wild, and full of curiosity. They stared at each other for a long while, but a silvery voice broke the silence.

  & “Can I have that?” Red asked, reaching forward and tugging at the sweater, the one wrapped round the Verido's waist.

  & Lupin blinked, and undid the sweater, handing it over without hesitation. Red slipped it on, then put a pink nose in it to smell it. 

  & “Hmm! Smells like sand – and earth! I can smell the hands that made it! Ah – I love sweaters, they say so much about a person and of the world. Every strand tells a story you know!”

  & The wonder was alive, and full of energy. Nothing about this situation appeared bizarre to Red, any normal person would have asked for a name and why they'd come up here, but Red did not care to ask these things. Lupin had wanted those lips to speak words, but now that this wish came true this fool of a tongue had somehow gotten itself into a terrible knot – plus all this talk of sweaters was confusing. Red was definitely a treasure, a lost, and forgotten thing. All these thoughts had been so distracting, somehow Lupin had missed it, but the bed of green was short of a person. Red was standing up, looking at the flowers, body swaying from side to side, as if there was a song playing no one else could hear.

  & The pale being then turned to face the stranger .“Are you ready to go? I’m dying to get down there to see what’s changed!”

  & Lupin swallowed hard. “Um. Wait. I have so many questions.”

  & “Later! All you need know, is that my name is {{Eka}}, and that fuzzy beast is–" the wonder paused, eyeing the furry companion over for a moment, as if trying to remember something important "–{{Hush}}! We are Eka and Hush!" Eka said, a hand brushing bits of red hair behind rounded ears. Hush, the {{hyroo}}, let out a whoop, taking a seat next to its master.
  
  & "I’m Lupin,” though something inside was saying that Eka already knew that. 

  & Eka inspected Lupin's face. "Lupin. Yes. I like it. Will you be my guide to the world then Lew?” Without waiting for an answer, Eka climbed up on Hush’s back. "You coming?"

  & There was a long moment of silence, but then an arm shot forward and gripped the Verido's collar, then, with a yank and a pull both were sitting on the beast. Eka smelled like wet grass, with hair so very red and short, a curtain of hair draped along the forehead and parted on one side, allowing those piercing red eyes to show. Seconds after that, Hush pushed off the ground with its powerful hind legs, bounding high and away from the mountain top, then, they started to fall fast, piercing the layer of wet clouds, the sandy world below coming into view. Eka laughed, while the other passenger tried not to scream. Hush made a few dampening landings, before paws touched the soft yellow soil. It had taken a long time to climb up there, coming back down so fast was rather dissatisfying. The wonder and Hush did not seem to care about this though, with all this excitement, came the realization that the mountain still bore no name. Combination of letters appeared in succession in Lupin's mind, forming words and possible names for it, but this was no time to make such a decision.

  & Lupin was breathing hard, with hair standing on end, both slid from Hush's back then. Red laughed at the state of the Verido's hair and brushed a hand through to comb it back into place, this gesture was a surprise, Eka had no problem with proximity, keeping a pale face a few short inches away.

  & “Where should we go first?” a button nose pressed right up and touched Lupin's.

  & No stranger had ever been so close, timid, Lupin's eyes became round, lips curled inwards, skin turning a deep shade of red. "W-what?" it was hard to keep oneself from stuttering.

  & "You're so timid!" 

  & Lupin pulled away then. "Not timid. Shocked is more like it. This is weird, you were unconscious just a moment ago."

  & "Do you always call things you don't understand weird? If you want weird weird, look at this–" Eka's ears wiggled about, independent of each other, and continued, waiting for a reaction.

  & Lupin raised an eyebrow, not sure how to react to this. This Eka was strange enough, but there was no malice in it, the Verido smirked and began to move these ears in the same fashion. To finish, the Verido's flute ears unfolded and flared open, before twisting back into shape. Eka watched the trick, and laughed aloud at the end.

  & "Here's something I bet you can't do." A whistle tunnelled out from the Verido's rounded lips, the sound was sweet-sounding and complex, it was a poem for the wonder.

  & Eka's expression was curious, a simple smile, but it would broaden and narrow down again depending on the words. Was it possible that Eka knew {{ilken}}? This made Lupin stop, and to turn to that familiar shade of red again.

  & Eka clapped both hands over those red cheeks. "You flush so easily Lew! Here I was thinking that the Volare national colour was blue!"

  & "It is blue, I blame the lack of altitude," Lupin said. "Wait. Did you understand the song?"

  & "Something about a red flower, on a green mountain," Eka said, smirking still. "I'm flattered."

  & Lupin couldn't believe it, how is it that everyone out here understands {{ilken}}? The Verido was going to ask about it, but didn't have time, Eka had wandered off and was running through the sand, kicking up loads of it and laughing.

  & “Do you know a city called Inepril?” Eka asked, kicking up more sand while exaggerating a walk.

  & It was possible the wonder had been asleep for ages, anyone else present would say that this behaviour was odd indeed. The Verido tried to ignore this, focusing on the question instead.  

  & "Vol went by it a few years ago, not much left there. When the waterstone pit went dry everyone left."

  & Eka paced back and forth, making a mental note of this. "Um. Okay. Then {{Montore}} it is!"

  & "Sure. Why do you want to go there?” 

  & Vol stopped there every year, it was a city that had grown large over the past few years. {{Montore}} was modern and exciting, but many thought it vulgar, even if they'd never laid a toe in it. The buildings were tall, and the population was dense, many important people lived there too. This is something Lupin had heard, or seen from atop the Ilk. 

  & “They make really good {{bam}} cakes there. Cakes paired with a fresh cup of {{Mepperpint}} tea.“ Eka paused, eyes closing with a hand pretending to hold a cup. "It's like your insides become green with it. Maybe they really do turn green, I've never checked."

  & Lupin did not care to know whether your insides changed colour when drinking tea, but this was something new, and the world would have so much of this! 

  & "I will get you a cup as soon we get there, and we'll fill your bag with it so we never run out!" Eka continued, before climbing back up onto Hush.

  & Lupin laughed at this and took a spot on Hush as well. "So we'll live off {{Mepperpint}} leaves then?"

  & "No. No you can't. If you do, your eyes will sprout leaves." 

  & Lupin fell silent, suddenly very afraid of {{Mepperpint}}.

  & Hush bounded off and carried them forward, this time there was nothing to fear, it was okay to join Eka in a laugh. This Verido of Volare was one step closer to forgetting life on the Ilk, that person was dead. Lupin was a creature of the world now. There was much mystery around Eka, but there would be time for answers later, for now, Lupin wanted to live in the present.

  & Eka, Lupin and {{Hush}} wandered the desert, quenching their thirst with {{waterstones}}. Hush could no longer stand any weight on its back and walked behind them, panting. They could not get to {{Montore}} fast enough, though the thought of cake and tea did offer some motivation. During the walk, Eka sang about {{bam}} cakes, listing the ingredients aloud in song. Every song ended with a solo of groans and growls, courtesy of Lupin's empty belly.

  & "Please stop singing about food." Lupin said. 

  & They'd tried to ration the {{teaweet}} bread, but Hush raided their stores in the night and all 5 loaves had already been digested. Both kept waterstones in their mouths, it helped in the absence of food. Saliva helped to draw out the water, in economical doses.

  & "We're going to die out here."

  & Eka did not look worried. "Haven't you ever walked this desert before? There is always something to eat and drink."

  & "You know I haven't," Lupin said, every mention of the word 'eat' was the stomach's cue to start whining again, "and if what you're saying is true, then why aren't we finding anything."

  & "Because it's too hot!"

  & "Of course, only {_idiots_} would be out here in this heat."

  & "The things you say, it's like you're not of this world! When nightfall we should be able to find some."

  & Lupin mumbled some words under breath, if anyone wasn't of this world it was Eka. It was true that this Verido, despite having read many books, did not know much of the desert. 

  & They hadn't been traveling together long, but the Verido knew already that Eka didn't like to explain things. They walked for some time, and then stopped in a spot, that looked no different than anywhere else - to the untrained eye.

  & "We'll set camp here."

  & Lupin was too tired and too hungry to complain. And so, using the chute, they built a makeshift tent. 

  > <hr/>

  & Come nightfall, Eka waited outside it, staring at the ground.

  & "Lew. Pssst! LEW! Come here."

  & Lupin groaned, rolling over to Eka outside. The fabric of the chute wasn't very big, it didn't make a proper shelter at all, just a small canopy under which they could lie. A lot of it was already filled with Hush's gigantic head, but the beast could not be persuaded to move. "What is it?"

  & Red pointed over to a collection of little stems pushing out of the soil, a fan of leaves opened up at the ends. 

  & "Take the one closest to you," Eka whispered. 

  & Lupin went to grab it, but all of the fanned stems went to hide back into the soil.

  & "You're terrible at this."

  & "This? I have no idea what {*THIS*} is!"

  & "Lower your voice–" Eka commanded, "–and be still. When the stems come back out and the leaves open up, clap your hands together real fast. It'll stun them, and you can grab one – haven't you ever harvested {{cactub}}s before?

  & "No," Lupin said. "What's a {{cactub}}?"

  & Eka laughed. "Only the best vegetable ever. I'll do it. Watch me."

  & Like before, the {{cactub}} stems emerged, and the leaves opened up in a fan. Eka neared two hands to one of them, and then...

  & {*CLAP!*} 

  & Red grabbed the stem and pulled it out. The {{cactub}} was a bul{{Bou}}s root vegetable, purple and covered in little round nubs. They peeled the skin off, and ate slices of it for dinner. {{Cactub}} was soft and sweet on the inside, and had many seeds. 

  & "You can eat these too, or toss them. They'll grow back from the seed if you do that. For every two I eat, I toss one," saying this, Eka tossed one seed over the left shoulder.

  & "Eat one-" Lupin said, chewing on a seed, "-toss one!" The other found its way back into the earth. They did this for a long while, smiling with every mention of {_'eat one'_} and {_'toss one.'_} 

  & Now with food in their bellies, they huddled-in together to stay warm, and to try to get some sleep. Their bodies ached, keeping them all very much awake. Eka looked at the sky and the stars, a finger tracing along the visible constellations and calling them by name.

  & "Salarus, Vitali, Neoneve-"

  & These names Eka recited every night before bed. The finger fell upon another star in the distance, lying low, and brighter than all others. A false star. It had taken some time for Lupin to doze off, Eka knew this but couldn't resist. 

  & “Lew! Something! Over there!”

  & Lupin turned to look, long-faced and red-eyed. “It's late. We’ll check it out in the morning.”

  & Eka had no intention of postponing this discovery. "Fine, you stay. I’ll be back.” Halfway through the sentence Eka was up and racing towards the point of light in the dark.

  & Lupin didn’t like this idea at all. In part because somewhere within, lived a fear that the wonder would leave and not return. This Verido had lost too much already, and decided to get up to chase red. It was easy to spot that wild head of hair in the dark. They arrived at the low star, which turned out to be a light affixed to the stern of a vessel. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand.

  & “It’s a {{sandfin}}!” Lupin said circling it, making out the details of it in the dark was difficult. The hull was yellow, and flat-bottomed. Then Eka pointed to one of the portholes, there was the faint glow of a light. Someone was inside.

  & “Who’s in there?” Lupin called out.

  & A thin-eyed, short thing, came peering out of one of the portholes. 

  & “I am most fearsome! I'm warning you!" a shrill voice said. "Where are you? {*Show yourself*}!" 

  & The creature stuck its face in the porthole, it contoured its large head perfectly. It looked like the {{sandfin}} had a face growing out of its side. The creature was a {{Finiku}}, large-eared with a wide flat face. The {{Finiku}}'s hair was light and wild, not a single strand seemed to point in the same direction. Eka giggled, and watched as Lupin approached the porthole so the {{Finiku}} could see better. Even when standing close, still, the {{sandfinner}}'s eyes looked everywhere but in the right place.

  & "Are you apparitions?! Where are your bodies! Oh no, no, no, no! Did I stumble into the {{ash plains}} again? The sights I took this morning were no good! No good at all!"

  & “What? No. We're fleshy people. We're right in front of you, can’t you see us?”

  & "Much too dark, too dark!” The {{Finiku}} replied, disappearing below. They could hear noises, as the owner of the vessel searched the cabin for something. Then a beam of light flashed in Lupin’s face. “Hmm. A Verido and a–” the owner of the {{sandfin}} moved the light around, searching for whoever this Verido was with.

  & “An Eka.” Eka said with a smirk, moving into the light.

  & “A Verido and an Eka. Friendly?”

  & Eka nodded. “Friendly and fleshy.”

  & “Your {{sandfin}} needs some repairs?” Lupin asked, blinking to try and get the lights in these eyes to go away. The {{Finiku}} - that they came to know as {{Nono}} - explained to them what had happened.

  & “{{sandfin}} won't move, I haven't the faintest idea why!" {{Nono}}'s eyes widened saying this, they were unusually clear and sickly-looking. Lupin saw there was plenty of light in the cabin, yet the {{sandfin}}ner claimed to see nothing.

  & “Right. Well, come daytime we’ll help you fix it."

  > <hr/>

  & The next morning, {{Nono}} emerged from the cabin and stood on deck. Lupin was up already, in truth, sleep had not come because of last night's events. {{Finiku}}s had a unique physique, they were short pot-bellied creatures with long droopy ears. Those clear sick eyes were disturbing, it was likely that {{Nono}} suffered from a bad case of cataracts. Eka too arrived at the foot of the {{sandfin}}, waving hello to its captain.

  & "Oh oooh! You are bigger than last night Eka," {{Nono}} said, standing right near the {{hyroo}} and getting ready to shake hands with it. Hush let out a long whoop.

  & "OH! OOOOh! What a morning voice!"

  & Eka laughed. "This is Hush, was asleep last night during our introduction."

  & "Ah I see, I see!"

  & "See? Are you sure you CAN see?" Lupin asked mockingly, that {{Finiku}}'s eyes definitely had a problem.

  & Now that light fell upon the vessel, they could see that it had suffered much damage. The {{sandfin}} struck a rocky patch and the rudder was ripped out. Most of the hull looked alright, but the area where the rudder had been had a large gaping hole. {{Nono}} leapt off the side of the yacht, and went to stand with the others to look at the wreckage.

  & The captain stood 3 heads shorter than they. "It's just a light kink! Oh, oh, ooooh, why won't it move!"

  & "A kink? You serious?" Lupin said, outraged. "There's a giant hole there at the back of it!"

  & "A hole you say? No, no, no!" 

  & {{Nono}} eyes narrowed down, to try and see the hole, all the while taking steps forward. Even up close, the {{Finiku}} was un-phased by the damage. It was only when standing a foot from it that the hole came into view.

  & "Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear–" 

  & {{Nono}}'s head shook from side to side, there was no stopping it. Eka went to stand closer, as if to offer moral support, and even laid a hand over the {{Finiku}}'s shoulder in an attempt to steady that tottering head.

  & "You have materials on board?"

  & {{Nono}} nodded, the shaking of the head had ceased then too. "Of course! {{Finiku}}s are prepared for anything! We can make another rudder. No problem. No, no, no problem at all! I have all the materials, everything we need!"

  > <hr/>

  & All 3 got to work. Lupin realized just how terrible {{Nono}}'s vision was. No one in their right mind would allow someone so blind to captain a ship. Eka gathered materials from inside the cabin, and all 3 began to devise a plan to build {{Nono}}’s {{sandfin}} a new rudder. They removed bits of the old one and took measurements. The rough shape they drew on the surface of a thick board, which Lupin believed, had once been a dinner table. They found a hacksaw too, stashed under a pile of spare lines. It was a quality tool, made of thin but strong metal. The name {_'Ren'_} was inscribed on the handle. 

  & "{{Renate}} steel!" {{Nono}} said, "the very best sort!"

  & By then, each had their own task to perform. Lupin cut the board, Eka was shaving the skin from a {{banabo}} stalk to make the rudder post, and {{Nono}} was busy retrieving bolts and nuts that would fit it. Tools and spares took up most of the space in the cabin, Eka wondered where {{Nono}} slept. They later learned that the sink was in fact a bed, all the bunks were dangerous due to the presence of lost bits of metal.

  & "Tried to sleep on there once," {{Nono}} began, "but I woke up with a set of nails in my side." Saying this, the {{Finiku}} showed the marks they had left behind. Lupin gasped, noticing there was another bit of stray metal in there still.

  & "Oh no, no, no."

  & The nail was taken out, somehow it lodged itself in there during the night. Even the sink was not free of dangers it seemed. All continued their work. Lupin was fascinated by the {{sandfin}}, they were a common sight while traveling on the Ilk. The {{sandfin}}s looked tiny from up there, the colour of their sails and the dust rising with their passing was all anyone could make out.

  & “What's that?” Lupin asked, pointing to a green jerry can that was stored on deck, "plumpkin juice?”

  & “Best renewable and combustible matter in the {{central rim}}," {{Nono}} said.

  & "Ilk droppings!" Eka said, then glimpsed the look on Lupin’s face and laughed.

  & Lupin had heard of this, but did not think it to be true. {{Nono}} explained that while the {{sandfin}} had no need of fuel there was always a can stored on this vessel. Many towns had need of it, many used it for cooking fuel. And so, carrying some aboard meant that {{Nono}} could help out those who had no access to it - which was most people. The company responsible for the supply ships restricted access to it, but sometimes some of it would end up in the hands of people like {{Nono}}.

  & "As a Verido, you know, know, know how big Ilk droppings can get! {{Beobug}} supply ships follow the Ilk and wait – they process it all aboard afterwards, very profitable business, very profitable! My mapa always hoped I'd work on a supply ship and would always say 'you would make good coin!', on and on and on–" {{Nono}}'s head shook again, recalling the things parents often said to their sproutlings. "You are so like your grand-mapa Etyl, not a coin in your pocket and always out there sandfinning."

  & "{{Etyl}} is your grand-mapa?" Eka asked. "That name is known all over! First one to travel the whole of the land by {{sandfin}}!"

  & {{Nono}} nodded. "Yes, yes! Did it alone too!" 

  & They completed the construction of their make-shift rudder and put it back into place, they also began work on patching up that hole around it. All the while, listening to stories of Etyl and the early days of sandfinning.

  > <hr/>

  & After a day of hard work, {{Nono}} tested out the rudder and saw no problem with it. {{Nono}} couldn't believe it. The hull was missing paint, but was otherwise immaculate.

  & "I have to make a delivery to {{Tiputa}} village, you can come along if you like!”

  & Lupin and Eka were happy to join the crew, {{Nono}} didn’t mind Hush coming along too and said that the {{sandfin}} could use the extra weight at the stern.

  & They unfurled the sails and set course for Tiputa, plowing through the sand and leaving a golden cloud in their wake. The {{sandfin}} was running downwind, with two blue wings pulling it along. The wind freshened, and the sands began to blow hard but handling a vessel with two more aboard was easy. Eka made sure the sails had a good shape, while Lupin kept an eye on the horizon, there was no trusting {{Nono}}’s eyes. The two crew members helped with navigation, making sure to avoid patches of hard soil. {{Nono}} had no sense of direction, and kept mistaking dunes for other {{sandfin}}s. Despite these handicaps, this so-called captain was confident and blamed it all on bad light. One night the {{Finiku}} offered to make dinner, one they would remember for a long time. {{Nono}} served them something that stank of {{pomparu}}. Lupin joked that dinner had probably been scraped off of the hull, their pained stomachs agreed with this theory.

  & Lupin asked about other {{sandfin}}ners, {{Nono}} knew many, but made a point of saying that most were not nearly as qualified. The shock of that reply caused a chunk of looma root (a Volare favorite) to lodge itself in the Verido's throat. A few coughs and gasps and the piece flew across the cabin, and onto the wall. If {{Nono}} was the best {{sandfin}}ner, it was terrifying to imagine what the others were like. Lupin pictured {{sandfin}}s in piles lining a city, hulls kinked-up and full of holes with {{Nono}}s at the wheel. All were sickly-eyed and yelling out orders while pressing a crew - that had long since mutinied - to get under way. The worse of it being that these sure-footed captains, were unaware of the fact that their vessels lay broken and unmoving.

  & {{Nono}} had brief moments of clarity, noting changes in the landscape with surprising accuracy. The crew thought it strange, surely there was no such thing as a condition that would better and worsen itself at random like this. Eka did not want to believe that {{Nono}} was a bad sandfinner. They spent a lot of time together on the vessel, and after a while they noticed a pattern. {{Nono}}'s vision was especially bad after drinking from the water stone tank. To extract the water out of the stones, there was a foot pump in the galley. The pump would press the stones down, the water would then be funnelled down a tube and come out of a tap in the sink. Eka and Lupin still used their personal stock of stones for water, and so one morning they opened the tank. It was full of {{mudbears}}, tiny insects that burrow in waterstones, and that ooze a substance that contaminates the water inside. {{Nono}} had been drinking bad water this whole time, it was the cause of these recurring {{Bou}}ts of blurry vision and disorientation. Eka offered {{Nono}} waterstones from their supply, and after drinking from a good source the symptoms wore off. {{Nono}}'s eyes no longer had that sick look, a pair of healthy orbs seemed to have changed the rest of the face completely. Eka went ahead and showed the contents of the tank to their skipper.

  & “Oh, no, no, no! That explains a lot! Usually, my passages are not so so so difficult! I thought this was due to the land of variable sands.” 

  & {{Nono}} laughed, realizing how terrible it would have been to not have met them, no doubt that the {{sandfin}} would still be rudderless. Lupin was against handing the tiller over at first, but Eka explained that the sickness was to blame and that all {{Finiku}} were fantastic {{sandfin}}ners. This was a fact, everyone knew this, most were born and raised in those vessels. It was in their {{klorea}}.

  & They arrived at their destination, within a few days time. {{Nono}} thanked them for their help.

  & “Must have caught those {{mudbears}} when I filled up at that old waterstone pit in {{Kippu}}. The villagers said it was a clean source. It's possible that they too, had these symptoms. I do do remember the Kippuans running into still objects a whole lot.”


Tiputa pit stop

  % content/fauna.pomparu.jpg

  & {{Tiputa}}, one of many towns of the {{Soronan desert}}. It is one road, with both sides lined by 5 triangular buildings, built with a slant pointing to the east, all businesses and all {{Finiku}}-owned. The road's very design suggests that you will leave almost as quickly as you have entered, with every service just a short hop away. 

  & {{Tiputa}} is on low-lying land, tucked into a valley known for its incessant gales. Strong winds, known in these parts as {*'Shriekers'*}, pass through here every 10 days. During this time, all activity in the town stops, the flurry of sand it generates can be very damaging to one's lungs. It is because of these 'Shriekers' that none stay in town for long, most come to re-supply, or for repairs, and then take off again. 

  & {{Tiputa}}, along with other towns like {{Kippu}}, Inepril (now deserted) and {{Renate}}, are built in windy places and exist primarily as relief stations for travel-worn visitors.

  > <hr/>

  & On this early morning, {{Finiku}} workers were outside with their brooms of dry {{banabo}} leaves. They brush the sand away from their storefronts, from the street, they dust their floor mats and polish their windows. All of this work will be undone the next day, but no matter, the task is then repeated and no one complains of it. 

  & Eka was wandering through town, looking at the stores and the workers. Everyone on the street said hello and waved, a diligent troupe of Finny sproutlings, armed with brooms, furiously brushed the sand away from the main road. The strip splitting the city was made up of flat stones, though most times, they lay buried and unseen. Eka enjoyed watching the early morning activities of others, more enjoyable, was the sound the dry fronds produced when brushed against the flats of the stones. The sproutlings were not aware of it, but there was a rhythm to their brushing. A song came to Eka's lips then:

  & "Brush the sands, sweep the lands-", then Eka's voice got louder at this next part, {*"-BRUSH, BRUSH, BRUSH!"*}, and went lower at this last verse, {_"sweep,  sweep, sweep."_}
  
  > <ul>
  > <li>{_"Brush the sands,_}</li>
  > <li>{_sweep the lands!_}</li>
  > <li>{_Brush, brush, brush!_}</li>
  > <li>{_Sweep, sweep, sweep!"_}</li>
  > </ul>
  
  & Eka didn't see that someone was standing there, blocking the way, an old {{Finiku}} with a long white river of hair, flowing downward and coming to a stop before splashing onto the ground. This stranger stared at the sweater, Lupin's sweater, wrinkled hands hovering close to it. 
  
  & "W-where did you g-get t-this?!" 
  
  & Like all {{Finiku}}, the stranger's body was short and circular. This character wore a red jacket and matching pantaloons, the jacket overlapped a shirt of delicate silky thread with frills at the neck and cuffs. These clothes didn't belong in a dusty place like this, the ensemble was worthy of a monarch.
 
  & "I will do {*ANYTHING*} to get this shirt! What do you want for it?"
  
  & Walking away not an option. The {{Finiku}} was gripping the shirt now, feeling the threads with greedy fingers. Lupin's sweater was put together well, but it paled in comparison to this character's royal attire, it had no golden stitching or sculpted cuff links. Nothing of that quality. 
  
  & "SO! It's coin you want is it?" 
  
  & With every question, and as desperation mounted, the {{Finiku}}'s stream of hair would spill out of perfection. Eka tried to back away still, but found the ancient thing still stuck to the piece of garment.
  
  & "It isn't mine to sell!" 
  
  & Most would think it easy to fend off someone so little, but the stranger held on, as if hanging from a cliff overlooking a fiery pit.
  
  & "Please! I must have it! I'll do anything!" 
  
  & With all of that pulling, the seams in the bottom of the shirt ripped open. The {{Finiku}} let out a horrified squeal. 
  
  & "{*WHAT*} have I {*DONE*}!"
  
  & Eka put a finger through the hole in the sweater.
 
  & "This is unforgivable! I–I am a fiend! I will make it better! Yes! I will mend it–"
 
  & Eka did not think it necessary, but the crimson-clad {{Finiku}} would not listen and led the sweater – as well as its wearer – over to one of the triangular houses. This one had a red roof, even the outer walls were painted red, although the paint was worn, the sand had a nasty habit of scratching bits of it off in passing. Eka wondered if everything inside was also red, and began to fantasize about a house with objects, walls and floors, so red that they were indistinguishable from one another. A sign over the entrance to the house read '{{Orin}} the tailor', with a handprinted sign underneath it with {*'now retired'*}. This sign had green lettering, this was enough to dispel the vision of this place being an a crimson funhouse.

  & "You make clothes? Convenient."
 
  & "Yes, yes. Well – I used to. Watch your head!"
 
  & Eka nodded, taking note of the height of the ceiling before putting knees to the ground, walking inside like this was easy, if not a bit hard on the knees. Both stood –more or less – inside the tiny workshop,its angled walls filled with spindles of colourful fabric, between the spindles lay frames with certificates of past commissions for royals and other famous characters. 
 
  & The retired tailor grabbed a needle, and then a short length of thread from one of the spindles on the wall. The spindle was soon emptied, all of it now lay on {{Orin}}'s needle. Then, time came to mend the sweater. {{Orin}}'s hands shook with age, but steadied when the point of the needle came in contact with the shirt. The tailor moved with machine-like precision, the thread disappearing into the garment and the hole coming to a quick close. The thread on the needle was the same colour and material as the shirt, {{Orin}} had just enough fibre to finish the repair. In the end, it's like it was never ripped at all.

  & Eka learned that the tailor used to live in {{Edonor}}, a place that - Eka made a point to say - made the very best Peachick pancakes. The {{Finiku}}'s great-great family opened a shop there many years ago. There was no doubting the popularity of the business, Eka glimpsed on the wall, a signed portrait of {{Bao}}, the second Monarch of the {{Iridi}}. Many other famous characters had come to the shop, all left a signed portrait behind as proof of their passing. Because the shop was so popular, {{Orin}} had no time for anything other than clothes-making. The tailor had an itch to make different sorts of clothes, more {_risqué_} items, but the customers always asked for the same thing: copies of copies of copies, all copies of past works- nothing new, nothing exciting. {{Orin}} did produce different types of garments, but few asked for them. It was then, that this tailor decided that it was time to retire to Tiputa, where {{Bou}}, a relative, now lived. 
 
  & "I'm sorry I'm not able to give this shirt to you, my friend's mapa made it you see. After I get some new clothes, it won't be mine to keep," Eka explained.
 
  & "I understand. I apologize for my untowardness. It's been a long while since I've seen such thread. But no matter - you need clothes? Well. I'll make you a set worthy of desert travel. I have a thread here that would suit you perfectly. Yes, yes. Come, come!"
 
  & After picking out some colours, the tailor pulled out a numbered tape and began to take measurements. It took some time to get all of it, Eka was tall – unlike {{Orin}}'s usual customers. The red head sat upon a stool, putting an arm, or leg forward as required.  
 
  & "Can't say I've ever seen anyone with round ears like yours."
 
  & "That is due to centuries of erosion that is! Had ears just like you before."
 
  & {{Orin}} laughed. "You and {{Bou}} would get along, always has something funny to say that one." After jotting down all of the numbers, the measuring tape returned to its place at {{Orin}}'s belt, it was attached there along with a needle and a single bobbin of thread. 
 
  & "You keep these with you always?" Eka asked.
 
  & "Never leave home without them! These are the weapons of the tailor!" {{Orin}} went to stand on another stool, a hand over the heart. "As long as I breathe, no fabric will be left unsewn, and no pant leg left askew! I will not allow it!"
 
  & Eka took a liking to {{Orin}}, a talented and honest artist with a good heart. 
 
  & "It will be ready in 2 days time," the tailor then said, with a shy grin.
 
  & As payment, Eka offered to help at {{Bou}}'s repair shop, {{Orin}} agreed, there was always a lot of work to do there, and with the westerlies coming in 3 days {{Bou}} probably had a long list of customers. They exchanged goodbyes, and Eka went to the repair shop. The place was small, again, because of its triangular shape, but could  accommodate a few persons. Like the interior of {{Nono}}'s {{sandfin}}, the workshop was brimming with tools, but in {{Bou}}'s defense, a small space was easy enough to fill. The repair shop owner glanced at the tall stranger, standing there at the door.  
 
  & "Need something fixed? Come back later. I've no time for it today." 
 
  & {{Bou}} was dark haired, pale-skinned, with a round body enveloped in a pair of tattered overalls, these, were stained with grease and covered in holes. Those tears must be torture for {{Orin}}, Eka thought, how did these openings escape the tailor's needle? 
 
  & "{{Orin}} is making some clothes for me and I offered to help you here in your shop as payment," Eka said, knees on the ground and wearing a great big smile. "I'm Eka."
 
  & The {{Finiku}} craned a large head to one side, the top of the door obscured the stranger's head. "You really want to help huh?"
 
  & Eka copied the head motion, "Yea, is that weird?"
 
  & {{Bou}} laughed at this. "In this town it is, not many willing to work without the promise of coin nowadays. Well - no matter. Suits me. Hope you like grime, grease and grossness." 
 
  & {{Bou}} welcomed Eka into the workshop and explained today's chores.
 
  & "We got a {{pomparu}} problem, stupid thing lodged itself into the exhaust pipe of a {{sandfin}}. Then, we got a busted water pump, person thought it a good idea to try and use it to press the juice out of an underripe plumpkin. Also got some trinkets that need soldering, then there's a rickety wagon outside that needs a new set of spokes, and the list goes on." 
 
  & {{Bou}} looked at what the outsider was wearing, and walked in close to touch the fabric of the sweater {{Orin}} had mended. For a second, Eka feared the same reaction in {{Bou}}. 
 
  & "Blue {{isilk}}." 
 
  & The greasy shop owner's green eyes went round, they had a shine to them, glass-like, two beautiful glass spheres with minuscule herb gardens growing inside of them.  
 
  & "Someone from Volare made this for you? I thought Verido never made isilk garments for outsiders." 
 
  & Not many people could tell the shirt was made from Ilk hair, even fewer knew that the hair of the desert walkers had a a subtle pigmentation, it could be either blue, green or red. This mechanic, with tattered overalls, had seen it right away. Eka wondered what the tailor thought of {{Bou}}'s profession, they were family,  yet their lives were so contrary. 
 
  & "This belongs to my friend," Eka explained. "{{Orin}} was pretty taken with it, even made a hole in it." 
 
  & "It's like finding the ghost of a friend at your door, a friend you thought dead." {{Bou}} said, fingers brushed over the area where the hole had been, no trace of it was left. "My grand-mapa Nok was head of shop in Edonor, somehow got hold of a spindle of blue isilk, illegally no doubt. {{Orin}} inherited the business later on, but all the thread had been used up. Nok made a death suit with it, jumped into the Rupture in it. I'll never forget the look on {{Orin}}'s face then, to have to watch a thread so fine fade into blackness. My mapa never had a chance with it, especially now that Verido don't trade it anymore. Thought you ought to know."  
 
  & {{Bou}} didn't give Eka a chance to reply, and walked over to a closet, pulling out a large pair of brown overalls and a mostly clean undershirt.
 
  & "It's dirty work, you should wear these instead." 
 
  & The {{Finiku}} knew the value of that shirt now, letting it get covered up with grease would be downright criminal. Eka changed into {{Bou}}'s undershirt and overalls, the clothes fit, but there was much room in there, for another Eka or two. The knees had padding - to cushion the knees from hard floors - and numerous pockets to keep tools in. 
 
  & Their first task, was to try and get that pomparu out of that pipe. The {{sandfin}} was moored out front, alongside it was the broken wagon, next to that was that box of damaged trinkets, and at the end of the line sat a very sad-looking water pump. Both moved to the back of the {{sandfin}}, Eka caught a whiff of the pomparu and gasped, hands jumped to cover up both the mouth and nose. Those creatures were renowned for their putrid smells. 
 
  & "Burns the nostrils doesn't it? First time I smelled it I couldn't eat for a week, everything I ate tasted like pomparu farts." 

  & {{Bou}} grabbed a jar from a pantleg pocket, and dipped a finger in it, scooping out a thick glob of purple gel. Then without warning, the purple gel was smeared under Eka's nose, just near and around the nostrils. {{Bou}} already had some purple under the nose. 

  & "{{Lavendiri}} flowers," Eka said, the fresh scent helped to cover up the nasty {{pomparu}} fumes. 

  & {{Bou}} also had a thick scarf on to keep the smell out, and passed one to Eka. The scarf, was just enough to block the stink entirely, and kept the {{Lavendiri}} gel fresh. 
 
  & Both turned to the {{sandfin}} then. The butt of the {{pomparu}} was sticking halfway out of the opening of the pipe, it had numerous sets of legs. Pomparus were plump creatures, pale-skinned and covered in colourful spots, the colours were hard to see because of the black exhaust stains. Pomparus were attracted to strong smells, this one tried to push its way inside the piping to get to the source, but got wedged into it. They were not clever creatures. It was common for people to make a pile of stinky rubbish outside of town to get their attention, and to keep them there. Tiputa did have a pile like this, but this {{sandfin}} had acquired the pomparu while on transit.
 
  & "It's not dead is it?" Eka asked, noticing its legs weren't moving.
 
  & "If it were dead, the stink would be so bad that we wouldn't be standing here talking about it. Lavendiri wouldn't be enough, it would rot under our very noses. We'd be out in the desert, with our heads buried in the sand, but even that wouldn't help. My friend Fala found a dead one once, couldn't bear it. The only way out was to get rid of the nose. Fala smoked too much Kavava leaves, wasn't right of mind at the time. Kavava makes you loopy." {{Bou}} said, telling this story as if it was nothing.
 
  & Eka's eyes widened, imagining someone without a nose. "How horrible."
 
  & "Some would argue that no nose is better, when pomparus are involved. Anyway, I made Fala a prosthetic, to replace it, so others wouldn't stare. A beautiful purple sniffer! Fa absolutely adores it! Calls it 'my special nurple'." 

  & {{Bou}} said this, hoping it would reassure Eka, but it had the reverse effect. 
 
  & "Whatever you do, don't touch it with your skin. You can say goodbye to family and friends if you do. I'm telling you, that smell does NOT come off!"
 
  & "So, um. Shall we do this thing then?" Eka's nose was eager to move on to some other task, it had no desire to be replaced with a purple sniffer. 
 
  & To get it out, both had to dislodge the pipe from inside the cabin, they took the whole thing out, then cut through the metal of the piping to shorten it. {{Bou}} covered the inside of the pipe with avoka oil, and reluctantly did the same for the area around the pomparu's body, all while wearing multiple thick pairs of elbow-high gloves, then, Eka shoved the small end of a broom through the pomparu-free end of the pipe, while {{Bou}} held it down with both hands. They could just throw the whole pipe away, bury it in the desert, {{pomparu}} and all, but that would be most cruel. {{Bou}} did not care to do such things. While Pomparus were less than ideal creatures, they didn't deserve such an end, no one did. 
 
  & "Ready?" Eka asked.
 
  & Eka pushed with such force, that the {{pomparu}} came flying out and went rolling inside of {{Bou}}'s workshop. {{Bou}} shrieked, tore the broom from Eka's hands and ran inside, but it was too late. The floor was covered with a stinky green discharge. The slimy, curvaceous thing, was pushed with the bristled end of a broom, out of the workshop, out of the city – well away from all the houses. Already some of the villagers were outside, noses pinched and eyeing the stinker, all were afraid of what this smell would do to the town's businesses. They all scurried about, covering the {{pomparu}} drippings with ground Lavandiri leaves and other strong-smelling flowers, while others began to scoop it up with long-handled shovels and brooms, items they too, would have to discard after us. All had purple gel under their noses.  

  & {{Bou}} took Eka's side, the broom was at the edge of town with that disgusting stink of a thing and marked where it was so no one would go near it. Those creatures were slow, and {{Bou}} had plans of putting a bowl of rotten muckwheat far out into the plains to lure it even further away.
 
  & Eka looked at the disgusting drippings it left behind. "All this came from one {{pomparu}}?"
 
  & "Looks like I'm going to have to add 'burn workshop to the ground' to the to-do list."
 
  & Both laughed at this, although Eka wondered if fire would really be enough to rid the place of that foul odour.

Beobug

  & Lupin was hanging out at the local snack bar at the edge of town. Everyone had agreed to meet here later that day, so right now was all about wasting time. The owner of the town's only restaurant served the foreigner a local drink, a glass of bonan wine. Bonan wine was an alcoholic drink that people would frequently brew in {{Finiku}} villages, every place had their own recipe. It wasn't uncommon to give some of yours to a friend, or to someone of importance, the restaurant owner Javi explained.

  & Javi was proud of the wine produced here in {{Tiputa}}, "best in all the land!" 

  & "Think others in the land say this too of their wine?"

  & "Probably–" the restaurant owner said, "–but they're wrong!"

  & Lupin laughed. "I've had bonan before, cut thin and dried as chips, never as a drink. How do you make it?"

  > <hr/>
 
  & Lupin spent much time conversing with Javi, that is, until Gree showed up. Gree was also a {{Finiku}}, and captain of one of the supply ships {{Nono}} had mentioned. Gree's hair was licked back with such tautness that it caused the eyebrows to float higher on the face. By {{Finiku}} standards, this new character was good-looking, and of good social standing given the uniform. Lupin imagined that {{Finiku}} parents aspired to have children like Gree, with a job that came with a title. One of the supply vessels was moored outside of town, it came in just a few hours ago, a huge double-masted {{sandfin}} with a green hull, the name 'Beobug II' was painted on its side in golden letters. The {{Finiku}} sitting here now was in charge of Beobug II, and was explaining how Ilk droppings were treated to be turned into gas to power machinery and vessels in {{Montore}}.
 
  & "It's really quite simple–" Gree began, "–the gas is generated through anaerobic digestion to produce methane, it also undergoes a process where carbon dioxide is removed to improve performance. It's very exciting work!"  
 
  & A worded speech by a devoted employee, sourced straight out of Beobug's hiring manual, Lupin thought. It was like watching a moving advertisement, especially with Gree wearing a matching company hat and ensemble. Lupin knew of this company, the Volare elders spoke ill of them most times, they thought it disrespectful to the Ilk to trail it in such a way. When in cities, the Ilk would be fed its weight in teaweet, then invevitably, came time to dispense of it- Beobug was always there to catch it all. The younglings always laughed, watching the adults, as near to Vol's rump as they dared, to better shout down at them, forbidding them to take the droppings. Of course the ships and its occupants paid them no mind, and it served to amuse the youth of Volare. 
 
  & "Those accursed Beobug {{sandfin}}s are out there again!" Pumra would say, "using excrement for energy, it's unnatural and downright sacrilegious!" 
 
  & Beobug was a big deal, it had plans to convert {{Montore}} to a fully-automated town. They tried to export barrels of it to other towns, but not many could afford it, nor had the systems in place to use it and instead relied on the wind for energy. The wind, as well as Ilk dung, was an inexhaustible source of power, but one of the two had a price tag. After Gree had finished paying hommage to the gods of Beobug, the captain threw an arm around Lupin.

  & "You and {{Nono}} are good friends I hear! You came in on the same {{sandfin}}. Small town, word travels!"

  & "You want something?" Lupin said.

  & Gree smiled, pearly whites coming into view. "You are bold, oh I like you! I'll get right to it then. {{Nono}} is the most talented {{sandfin}}ner I know, but package delivery is a waste of talent! Beobug I needs a captain, I've asked and asked but have been turned away every time. I've asked too often! I need another to do it instead of me. I understand you have quite a title yourself, Voice of the Volare Ilk! Perhaps you could use some of that prestige to persuade {{Nono}}?"

  & It was a mistake to mention being Voice – Lupin blamed the bonan wine. No one had ever said that being Voice was prestigious, perhaps it was viewed as such to outsiders. Seeing that the Verido seemed hesitant, Gree spoke up again. 

  & "You speak the language of giants! You have more authority than you think, using a title to get your way is perfectly acceptable."

  & Lupin's head was swimming. "Are we still talking about {{Nono}}? I don't understand why a title is so important."

  & "I sense a lot of hesitation in you. You are a grand being, and should be treated as such, others will listen to you if you make it clear to them who you are." 

  & This, was an insight into {{Montore}}, a place where titles were important and where currency reigned. Perhaps Gree befitted the title of captain, but this did not mean that it could be used to dismiss or influence others.

  & "I don't know–" Lupin said, attempting to move away but Gree's arm was as a solid and unyielding as an iron bar. "You really think being the captain of a vessel that recycles Ilk dung is worthy of praise?"

  & "YES!" Gree threw hands up into the air, as if in praise of some invisible deity in the ceiling. "It means limitless energy! My work shall propel {{Montore}} to such heights, we will be bathing in coin! Away with poverty and desperation, an age of automation and leisure awaits!" Gree said, eyes aglow.

  & "Wind is free." Lupin said, "why bother with anything else? It creates smokestuffs doesn't it?"

  & Gree smirked, "Just a bit, nothing terribly damaging. You seem to think yourself taint-free, your people take a free ride on a living beast and have for the better part of the last 3 centuries. It keeps you from the worst of this world. You've no idea of the sort of life we ground-folk lead down here." The captain eyed Lupin carefully then. "Well, you are learning it now, aren't you? You're in the dust, with the rest of us."

  & "The Ilk is a friend. We co-exist." Lupin said, trying to hide the anger brewing in this heart. 

  & "That's what we're doing too, co-existing. Another glass Javi my friend!"

  & Javi went to pour a generous serving of bonan wine to both, a bit of it overflowing outside the vessel.

  & "The dung helps to fertilize the land, if you take it all, things will not grow." the Verido insisted. 

  & "You do not think we really take it ALL?" Gree said, laughing aloud. "Even so, food patches solve all this, and are much better for you." The captain lifted up a sleeve to show one of those patches, pressed onto the skin, "This is my lunch."

  & "Ah I see, another {{Montore}} industry. Another way to amass coin, a path to the creation of more titles." a glass of empty bonan wine sat in Lupin's hand, "did I drink all of this just now?" Gree's glass was also empty, but Javi was there to fill them right back up again.

  & "Industry means progress."

  & "Progress means coin."

  & "Coin is the way of the future, Voice of the Volare Ilk, you'd best get used to it."

  & "What is there to do with so much coin?" Lupin said. "It's heavy, a burden really." 

  & The Verido believed in trading, they did not accept coin for services or items, attributing value to a seemingly worthless piece of metal was a strange concept for them. Coin makes people crazy, for some reason everyone seems to want to amass a vast amount of it. Lupin tried to picture Gree in a bath of coin, and failed to see the enjoyment in it.

  & "Coin is the measure of all beings, tiny medals of success," saying this, Gree pulled out a shiny golden coin, which in turn, found itself into the palm of Lupin's hand. The coin had a face printed in its centre, but the quality of the engravings made it hard to make out its features. The phrase '{{Montore}}: might is right' was inscribed on it, and on the flip side was the number one hundred. Lupin was going to return the coin but Gree refused it.

  & "Keep it, consider it payment for the little favour I asked you just before. You will take my proposition to {{Nono}} won't you?"

  & The Verido thought it strange to be entrusted with such a task, but with a gift of such value, with this coin that presumably had the power to elevate one's spirit in such a way, it was better to pocket it and to accept. Lupin would mention it to {{Nono}}, but would not insist on it. Just then, Gree said goodbye and stepped off of the stool, jelly-legged, and returned to the crew aboard Beobug II.

  & Lupin stayed at the bar then, couldn't put a phrase together. Javi laughed at the state of this stranger, "Have some muckwheat dumplings, they're stuffed with bonions, dilly herbs and looma roots. You Verido like looma roots don't ya? These will help imbibe all that wine in your stomach, lessen the effect." Javi pushed a plate of steaming dumplings in front of the Verido, "On me."

  > <hr/>

  & Not long after, {{Nono}} re-emerged from a client's house, content, and ready to relax. Now armed with a pouch full of coin, {{Nono}} felt it necessary to treat the crew mates to a drink. All three gathered at the snack bar, savouring pints of plumpkin ale, although the Verido had opted for tea instead. Lupin had a headache, the dumplings helped with the jelly-headedness but did little to ease the other pains of drinking your weight in wine. 

  & Eka told them of the incident with the {{pomparu}}, the fixing of the waterstone pump and all the other items on the list they'd been tasked with. Because of Eka's experience with the pump on {{Nono}}'s {{sandfin}}, it took just a minute to get it done. Today, they crossed many other items off that list, they managed 3 days work in just a day's time. Eka still wore the wide pair of overalls, large clothing was always more comfortable, even if they were black with soot and streaked with grease.

  & Lupin spoke of the encounter with Gree, upon hearing that name {{Nono}}'s face showed disgust.

  & "AH! That stink of a {{Finiku}} asked YOU to ask ME to captain that monster of a ship? Oh, no-no-no-no–" the {{Finiku}}'s head began to shake, the shaking did not stop for some time. Eka wondered if their friend was stuck in a loop and needed help, but {{Nono}} recovered moments after that. "No-no-NO is what I say and will always say!"

  & "Being on a ship like that must be impressive, sounds like a prestigious post too. Why not do it?" Eka asked, the large ship at the edge of town was hard to miss.

  & "No-no-nobody is the boss of me! I enjoy my freedom." {{Nono}} said with pride. "I have no-no-no, desire to be packed into a tin can with a crew, nor do I care to stare at an Ilk's heinie all day."

  & Both Eka and Lupin laughed at this. {{Nono}} went on to say that they were both grown on the same plot of land, because of this Gree thinks them to be close. 

  & "While I spent my young years traveling and {{sandfin}}ning, Gree stayed in our home village and poisoned my mapa against me. Said I was wasting my time, that the only job worthwhile is behind the wheel of a Beobug vessel." 

  & Not just this, {{Nono}} explained that the Beobug {{sandfin}}ners were a crooked bunch, scamming at every turn and profiting from others. The company ships were also heavily automated, the captain did little but give orders. 

  & "Don't tell anyone, but I keep tabs on the Beobug {{sandfin}}s. Ponopo watches Beobug II, two other woths I have watch the others. I correct some of their misdeeds, which are there are many, those good for no-no-no-thing Beo-bums will not taint the name of {{Finiku}}s. No-no-NO they will not!"

  > <hr/>

  & As the evening went on, {{Nono}} began to tell some {{sandfin}} stories, like the one about the notorious Dorake’s passage, a passage feared by many, one known to have buried countless {{sandfin}}ners over the years. {{Nono}} made the passage to teach the route to a young colony of messenger woths. Dorake's passage was a shortcut to the southern dust plains, the woths would make better time if they used it. They only needed to do the route once with a teacher, after that, they would remember it for the rest of their lives. 

  & {{Nono}} whistled, and called over a personal woth messenger, the creature was small, but looked tough. It had short antennae, as well as delicate yellow hairs all over its body.

  & “This is Ponopo, carries all my messages home for me. Its traveled to many lands, knows most of the world routes!” 

  & Ponopo fluttered off of {{Nono}}’s hand, and landed on Eka’s head.

  & “How can I get my hands on one of those?” Eka said, watching Ponopo hover back down onto the table. Its antennae wiggled about, as it happened upon a patch of spilled plumpkin ale. These creatures were well known in these parts, the look of them was familiar, but Eka couldn't quite remember.

  & {{Nono}} pulled out a box, laid it out on the table and opened the lid. Six round eggs sat in it, laying over a soft blanket. 

  & “Woth eggs.” {{Nono}} told them, “I always carry some around to gift to clients.”

  & {{Nono}}'s hand reached into the box and picked up an egg. “They’re ready to hatch, but will only do so when matched with a person. Woths are loyal, they will follow you anywhere, even in death."

  & {{Nono}} reached over the table and grabbed Eka’s hand, and placed a single round woth egg into the small of it. As soon as the egg came into contact with skin, it turned a sky blue colour.

  & “It’s blue!” Eka said, amazed by the unborn woth.

  & “Blue? They never turn blue. Yellow and white are the usual colours.” {{Nono}} said, looking very confused “No-no-no matter. Now, put a finger on the top of the egg, and do soft gentle strokes.”

  & Eka did as {{Nono}} instructed and put a finger on the egg, stroking it. 

  & “The less strokes it takes, the better the woth.” {{Nono}} continued. A loud scream bellowed from the tiny body when the blue egg cracked open, after only a single stroke! “That is unheard of!”

  & Lupin and Eka watched as a new woth emerged from the egg, its body was blue. It’s antennae were long, and it had a quite a wingspan too.

  & “It looks so strong!" {{Nono}} said, shaking a head in disbelief, a reaction they had gotten used to by now. 

  & Eka knew many things, but knew little of woths, although this one, did appear larger than Ponopo. {{Nono}} grabbed a measuring tape and jotted down every detail, the colour of its fur, the length of the hairs and of the antennae, diameter of the eyes too – everything. 

  & “Next time I visit my friend's hatchery I’ll ask about this, they would know, they would for certain!” {{Nono}} put the tape away, and continued to marvel at the quality of Eka's woth.

  & “What should we name it?” Eka asked Lupin.

  & “Oh no-no-no! Woths name themselves!” {{Nono}} said, waving a finger at them. “The tricky part is trying to guess what it is.”

  & “How long did it take you for Ponopo?”

  & {{Nono}} took a long sip of plumpkin ale, after 4 pints the {{Finiku}}'s skin should have a red tinge to it, but it remained unaffected. “5 years. Thought of it after ingesting some bad herbs. Friend of mine though, poor fellow, took 20 years.”

  & “20?!”

  & “Yes, yes! Named itself Mu-mu-mu-mu-mumford, that woth was a stutterer as it turns out.” {{Nono}} paused, only to give way to a loud belch. “They’ll listen to you with or without a name, but it strengthens the connection you know? Although, some think that perhaps the woths have no name, and are just waiting for the right one to come along. In that case, it means most woths are a fussy, fussy bunch.”

  & Eka hoped it wouldn’t take that long, a 20-year long guessing game did not sound fun. “You’ve got an easy name, isn’t that right… Tom-tom?” a finger traced along the soft hairs on its back. The woth went about its business, and joined Ponopo on the table to get some of that sweet plumpkin juice.

  & "Tom-Tom?" Lupin said with a laugh, "It looks more like a Pino."

  & The 3 had an unsuccessful evening of name-guessing, after a few hours of this, Eka and Lupin said their goodbyes to {{Nono}} and went to raise their tent in a clear space on the outskirts of town.

  & “Would have loved to continue to travel in a {{sandfin}},” Lupin said, watching the unnamed woth wing its way through the air, drawing shapes as it did. They wondered if this was its way of communicating its name, but it turned out to be complete gibberish.

  & Eka agreed. “They’re wonderful aren’t they? Wish the cabin was taller though, must have hit my head on the cross beams 10 times during the voyage.” 

  & Lupin thought about something then, about name-giving, Verido have a name written on their faces but this wasn't true for everyone. "Did you pick your own name?"

  & Eka didn't answer right away, brows furrowing as if in deep thought. "Yes, I've had many names though."

  & "Do you remember being born?"

  & "Nope, but I have slept for long periods of time. I imagine being born is like waking up after a long sleep."

  & Another question burned at the Verido's lips, "What about dying? Where do you suppose we go after we're dead."

  & "We disintegrate, we become part of the world. I've seen it happen, again and again."

  & "What about my mind? Where do you think that goes?"

  & "Nowhere, and everywhere. It was like before you were born. That was an okay time wasn't it?"

  & Lupin shrugged. "Yea. I guess so."

  & "We're all part of the grand sweater that is our universe; we are a single thread and together we form a complex design, criss-crossed and stitched over one another into a variety of interconnecting patterns. Sometimes these individual patterns unravel; but they're not lost, they remain part of the grand sweater." Saying this, Eka began to unravel Lupin's sweater, tugging on a loose bit of twine. 

  & Lupin noticed this, and moved closer to help undo it. "I like this analogy."

  & "Analogy? You mean you don't adhere to the idea of a sweater-verse?"

  & Both spent the evening unraveling the isilk sweater until it was back to not being a sweater at all, just a collection of thread. 

  & "You'll be there to watch me unravel, I don't know how I feel about that." Lupin said, the bundle of thread in hand.

  & Eka leant over to rub noses with the concerned Verido, "you need to exist and not worry about such things Lew." Seeing that Lupin wasn't feeling any better, Eka locked foreheads with this stubborn worrier and spoke again. "How about some bobonion soup?"

  & "I'd like that." Lupin replied.

  & Eka cooked up a pot of bobonion soup, which they ate with some slices of toasted muckwheat bread. Then, they recited poems about the sweater-verse until they feel asleep. Lupin did not dream of death that night, but rather of a world where everyone looked like a stuffed knit plush. Sproutlings made a game of unraveling each other's arms, while the adults scolded them. The sand was soft to the touch, with giant stitches keeping it all together; the vegetables were comically overstuffed, round and made of hairy fabric. Lupin was in this dream, and there, hanging from the side of this wrist was a connecting thread, connecting this Verido to an {{Adoal}}, to a {{Finiku}}, a Looma root. This was {_the thread_} that bound all things in the known world and beyond.

  > <hr/>

  & The next day, Lupin and Eka spent some time with {{Bou}}. Since they'd finished all of their tasks so early, the repair shop clerk closed the store for the day and introduced them to some of the locals. They were treated with muckwheat bread, a local specialty. Everyone they came across would try and give them their own batch of bonan wine, they sampled some of it but when Lupin's words began to merge incomprehensibly with one another they decided it best to stop. One of {{Bou}}'s friends, had a few {{vennec}} babies and insisted on showing them off. 

  & Vennecs were large, humpbacked, furry beasts with thin snouts, large pointy ears and a long slender neck. Their ears were big to better dissipate heat. The vennec babies were all asleep in a pile, it was hard to tell where one started and another ended. Though soon, the babies were on their feet and ran circles around them. Eka laughed, stroking their soft hairs. Lupin's face was buried in the fur of one of the larger cubs.

  & "They're too young to leave, but in a year's time you're free to come back and adopt one," the vennec grower said. "That one is a strong fellow too, will be able to travel far with you." 

  & Having a pup now would not be practical, they had much traveling to do with all the places Eka wanted to visit. Lupin liked the idea of adopting a vennec, and made a promise to return in a year's time. "You'll keep this one for me won't you?"

  & The grower nodded.

  & Lupin caressed the vennec between the ears, "see you later then, little Aristollo."

  & "Aristollo?" Eka said, eyes wide and glancing over at the Verido. "But that's the name of a-"

  & "Skyrock? Yes, I know that."

  & "No. Well- yes. But it's also the name of an-"

  & "Iridi?" Lupin's mouth curled into a smile, it was nice to feel all-knowing for once, a rarity around someone like Eka.

  & "Yes again! WOW! Lupin you know everything!"

  & "I know of a hundred ways to prepare looma roots," Lupin began, "but I don't know the story of Aristollo. I'd like to hear it, if you know it."

  & Eka smiled, "It's better told through the mouth of an Iridi. We'll find someone to tell it to you, and on the way, you can tell me of the hundred ways to prepare Loomas."

  & "I really couldn't. Just the word itself, even after having just eaten, never fails to make me hungry."

  & "The muffled cries of your stomach pairs well enough with my singing." Eka said. 

  & Both were making their way back to the camp, Lupin held a hand up to make a landing platform for the woth. That morning, they had received a little portable house for their new friend as a gift, a round glass ball with a gap at its side to be used as a door. Inside it was an inner wall of soft fabric, there was so much of it that the woth could easily find a spot in there and stay hidden. The ball was wrapped in yellow thread and had a permanent attachment to Lupin's backpack. {{Bou}} had left the gift hanging at the entrance of their tent. Vacation time was a rarity in these parts, people worked all day everyday. Eka's help in the shop made it happen, and in thanks the {{Finiku}} made a little something special for them. The woth landed on Lupin's hand, and then climbed down and found its way into the glass ball, burying itself in it.

  & "Rest well Duster," but the woth did not react to this name either.

  & "Not even a twitch," Eka said, looking at the sleeping messenger, "it's a nice name, maybe it didn't hear it."

  & They weren't sure what the rules were, how would the woth react once it heard its own name? Maybe it would produce a sound, flutter extra harder, or maybe it would change color again? Lupin wished they'd asked {{Nono}} more questions, but the {{Finiku}} had left last night for another delivery, both suspected that Gree had something to do with their friend's early departure. The three had already said their goodbyes, and had accepted a gift of a bottle of bonan wine, which they guessed would be stronger than all the others they'd tried today given {{Nono}}'s high tolerance to alcohol.

  > <hr/>

  & The following morning, even before Eka had time to slip on some day clothes, {{Orin}} appeared at the door a bundle in hand. The clothes were ready and the tailor was eager to see them on a person. Eka changed out of these night clothes while Lupin brought the {{Finiku}} some herbal tea, served with a slice of lemone lime and some grated sweet root. By now, word had spread in the village that the Voice of Volare was here, in a small town like this there could be no secrets. Gree had told others, and it made it to {{Orin}}'s ear. The tailor was unusually quiet, and stared a the blue-faced Verido. Verido were rare in these parts, Ilk did not pass in this village given their size. They passed by Edonor every year, but there was so much to do in the shop that neither Nok or {{Orin}} had ever glimpsed it.

  & Eka appeared before them, wearing a new set of clothes designed for desert travel. The trousers were loose, yet tight in the right places. They drew up over Eka's midriff and held there without the need for a belt. The undershirt looked plain to the untrained eye, but it was quality fabric (100% {{banabo}} fibres) and the stitching was reinforced around the neck and shoulders. {{Orin}} even made a scarf with sleeves, large enough to throw over your head for added protection.  

  & "You are a true master! These are wonderful!"

  & {{Orin}}'s face reddened at those words. "Oh it's nothing, really! It pleases me that you like it."

  & "I LOVE it!" Eka said.

  & The tailor had not noticed then, but Lupin had moved to the end of the room. The Verido came back with a large bundle of thread and placed it onto the {{Finiku}}'s lap.

  & "Volare Isilk." {{Orin}} said, voice high with emotion.

  & Lupin nodded, at the snack bar Eka had explained how the tailor loved the shirt, and how those hands had never made anything with isilk, and so, that whole evening was spent unraveling the sweater, it was then re-bundled and bound with a matching blue ribbon. 

  & "Now you can make something for yourself with it," the Verido said.

  & Just then, {{Orin}} began to bawl, fingers curling around the precious bundle of thread. "T-t-this is too much!" there was no stopping those tears, "Y-you are t-too k-kind."

  & It was a great way to end their time here in Tiputa. The tent was packed away and they began their long walk to {{Montore}}, city of coin and titles.

Skyrock

  % content/fauna.seshell.jpg

  & This is the tale of a lonely piece of matter, it had once been part of some other larger body but they'd since parted. There was no way to measure how much time had passed since then - which was just as well, because this didn't matter out here. The sky rock had seen much of the universe; it no longer grieved for home, nor did it fear the unknown. Contrary to what it thought, the great expanse did not inspire fear; it was soothing, everything made sense here. The celestial bodies danced with one another, a slow and unending waltz. 
  & The rock rather liked the time it had spent adrift, but then it neared the atmosphere of a yellow planet and was pulled down onto it. It lost much of its mass in the descent, but had enough to cause a great big fuss when it struck land. 
  & Now, skyrock was faced with a new reality, but it knew that one day the waltz would resume, and so skyrock's mind quieted.
  & It sat idly for many years, it saw the sun and moons pass all too many times; it wasn't tiresome, on the contrary, it celebrated each passing and would count them up.
  & {_"..."_}
  & In truth, skyrock did not know how to count, but it liked to try. It was about to assign an outrageously large series of numbers and letters to this next moon passing, when some land-dwellers stopped a short distance away. A shell lodged itself in the paw of their furry mount, and the riders were forced to get off. 
  & They were travellers. One with hair like the sun and the other bearing the colour of the sky on its face. Skyrock gave them names then: {_Sun and Sky_}.
  & These two fleshy beings were unaccustomed to a ground composed entirely of disintegrating shells, they were fascinated with it and began to search,   to try and find the most beautiful shell of all - making a contest of it. The skyrock did enjoy this game, wondering if perhaps it too qualified as a shell. Sun found one that was twisted in a near impossible shape, turning and coiling and somehow ending back onto itself. Sky had dug up a shell of a most peculiar shape, it had a face carved into it - Skyrock knew these well.
  & "Um. Lew. That's a {{seshell krab}}," Sun said.
  & Sky had no idea what a {{seshell krab}} was, but then multiple pairs of legs came pushing out of the sides of the shell, along with a set of tiny black eyeballs sitting atop long thin strings of skin. Sky screamed and dropped it to the ground; this amused skyrock - oh the sounds these fleshy ones could make!
  & The {{seshell krab}} began to throw bits of broken shells over itself, burrowing deep into the ground until you could no longer see it. It was not rare for one of them to burrow underneath skyrock, and to cause it to shift to a new place - this too, was fun, it wondered where it would shift to next.
  & "Are they ALL alive?!" Sky said, breathing hard.
  & "No, just the ones with faces. Avoid those if you can. They're bad tempered. If you mess with them they'll chase you to return the favour. They never forget a face."
  & "What if they only saw half my face?" Sky said, coiling a piece of blue fabric to conceal part of it.
  & "Then all who share your upper face are in trouble. Bit selfish don't you think?"
  & "What if... I had no face?"
  & "Then everyone's a potential victim. Again, kind of mean no?"
  & Sky's eyes widened. "Scary."
  & Sun started to whistle a tune and found yet another impossible shape: a flat shell coiling and again, ending back onto itself. "Look at this one!"
  & Sky seemed to envy Sun, wishing to find a shell as interesting as this. Then, skyrock caught the eye of this blue-faced scavenger and grew nervous; no two-legged land dweller had ever come this near to it.  
  & "Beautiful," Sky said, eyes aglow and nearing a hand to it.
  & "Disqualified!" Sun shouted, skyrock fidgeted with ever-growing excitement. "That's a skyrock, not a shell."
  & "Really? I thought they'd be bigger than this."
  & "They lose bits of themselves when they fall."
  & "Oh - that's sad isn't it? Losing bits of yourself," Sky said, looking at this rock from all angles. 
  & "You lose bits of yourself all the time too you know." 
  & "You mean like skin, hair and things?" Sky said, trying to picture this body worn down to the size of a fist.
  & "Does it makes you sad?"
  & "Not really, I don't know why I said that." Sky's fingers traced around the flat face of skyrock then, "there's nothing sad about you Skyrock. You're the most experienced of us all, and too beautiful for this ball of dust."
  & Skyrock felt proud. It was in a most wonderful state too, time and weather had smoothed down its exterior. The two land dwellers were very   impressed with this, and decided to transform its body in a very big way. Sky rock was ground down further, and shaped into two pendants, a string was tied to one end. Sky rock was now split in two, it hung around the necks of each land-dweller. It could see itself on the breast of the other, it was a most unusual sight. Sky rock relished in this new perspective. {_"How wondrous"_} it thought.
  & Sky and Sun returned to their fuzzy companion, and left the sea of broken shells behind.

An oasis

  % content/fauna.floater.jpg

  & Lupin and Eka arrived near a hollow, they did not have to come through here to go to {{Montore}} but Eka had insisted on it. This place, {{Nono}} had said, was wrought with strange creatures. They were instructed to transit quickly, but their sore feet gave them much trouble. The two experimented with walking fast, making much distance but getting tired faster, or walking slow, making little progress but with more energy to spare. When Hush was in a good mood, they would do a few long leaps ahead, this too, helped to shorten the trip.
  & Near the hollow, Hush sighted round creatures hovering in the distance, its ears perked up, attentive to the faintest of sounds. Something was wrong, the {{hyroo}} would not move forward, fearful of the strange beings ahead. The creatures had two black points for eyes, long fluttery wings on the sides of their bodies and tiny slits for mouths.
  & “Whoa look at those! Had ballons just like that on my last green day.”
  & Eka grabbed Lupin’s shoulder, “remember what {{Nono}} said.” These creatures, these {{floater}}s were not unfamiliar to Eka, but little was known of them - people made a point of avoiding them.
  & Lupin did not believe they could be dangerous and took a step forward, as if to prove the rest of the group wrong. It was instinctive to associate roundness with passiveness, a being with points though, would be cause for concern. Determining levels of hostility according to shape did not prove to be convenient in this case, perhaps it could be useful in a world of all-geometric animals. 
  & The creatures reacted to the intruders that stood near, they turned a solid red colour and darted towards them. Eka leapt onto Hush and   reached over to grab Lupin’s collar, but one of those creatures splattered onto the {{hyroo}}'s side and another to Lupin’s chest. Their bodies were sticky and soft like goo, and burned like hot coals. 
  & In a panic, Hush bounded off, fast and far into the distance. Eka kicked at the soft gooey body to get it off, but after every hit the skin would just bounce back into shape. Hush landed with a roll, sending all passengers cascading onto the ground. The poor beast was rubbing its side on the sand and clawing at the parasite with its hind legs. Fingers and nails were not enough to get this spherical vampire to let go, Lupin had even tried hitting it with the butt of a mug. Nothing worked. Hush leapt into the air again, as high as Eka had ever seen it jump. The beast became a point into the sky, just another star in the firmament.
  & There was no way to help Hush now, and so Eka went to assist the other sufferer. The creatures were very hot to the touch, and had burned through Lupin's vest and undershirt already. Lupin was in agony, body twisting on the ground.
  & “I can’t get it off!” Eka cried, hands and nails digging at the balloon-bodied demon.
  & Moments later, Hush returned, the parasite was gone but the skin where it had been had been stripped of all fur. This is how they would get rid of them: altitude and cold! Eka whistled for Hush and climbed onto its back, pulling Lupin up along.
  & "Take us up again Hush! As high as you can!”
  & Like before, Hush jumped up high and fast. Within seconds, the creature abandoned its host. When they landed again, they were a good distance away, leaving those fluttery fiends behind.
  & Lupin lay on the ground, speaking through gritted teeth, “I should have listened to you. Those things - why do they attack people?”
  & "They're territorial, I know that, but there's usually not so many together in one place." There was some logical explanation, but right now Eka focused on a more important task: crushing waterstones over Lupin's wounds, to help reduce the pain and swelling. 
  & After a few minutes of this, the injury was covered with a dressing to keep air and sand from the skin’s surface. Hush had the same treatment. It was nearly nighttime, and with two wounded it was best to set camp here. After that ordeal everyone needed to have a good long rest. 
  > <hr/>
  & Lupin's condition worsened in the night, Eka made some tea laced with herbs known to help in the event of infection, but was lacking many key ingredients. Most of the stocks they had were from Tiputa, but it being a small village meant that they had few herbs to spare. Their travel party needed a place to stay for a while, staying out here was not an option and the next town was some ways away. Tomorrow, Eka would try and search the land for the missing herbs, this was the only solution available to them.
  & Come daytime, Eka prepared breakfast for everyone: nuni nuggets. {{Nuni}} was a starchy tuber with bright yellow flesh, it had a taste and smell that could best be described as being robust. {{Orin}} had prepared a parting gift of tubers and other roots for their journey, this had been part of it. Lupin was especially fond of nuni, Eka suspected that the Verido enjoyed the way it stained the inside of your mouth more than the taste of it. They ate quite a few of them on the trek over here, and made bets on who's mouth would be most yellow. The skin and tips of the nuni were placed into a jar along with some brine (prepared earlier that morning), the left-overs would be left to pickle for a few days and would be enjoyed as another meal.
  & The food was divided into 3 plates, but before breakfast could be served, a plump leaf-tailed orange hound appeared at the entrance to the   tent, mouth agape, gushing with saliva. Eka wondered where this {{leafhound}} came from, there was nothing out here - or perhaps there was? Glancing behind the hound, these red eyes locked onto a distant point of colour, a spot of green. Red smiled, relieved.
  & “Is that where you came from?”
  & The hound barked, and this triggered a series of faint yaps and yips, all coming from the faraway green smudge. By then, a pool of clear   slime had accumulated at the hound's feet, dripping from its long purple tongue; it was cruel to ask so many questions, without the promise of compensation. Eka cut away a piece of nuni and tossed it over, the hound gobbled it up, and waited for more. “You really like that don’t you?" Eka said.
  & Breakfast was served, although Lupin was in a feverish state and could barely consume any of it. Hush had no problem eating its breakfast, and despite Eka's warnings, it still helped itself to Lupin's portion.
  & "Yea, yea. I know, I know - you've got 2 stomachs," Eka said, caressing Hush's fur. "Right now you're the {{Mapa}} okay? You take care of Lew while I'm gone."
  & Hush's ears twitched at the word 'gone', while not familiar with the etymology of the word it recognized the sound and length of it and   associated it with a moment of absence, a thing it didn't like. Hush let out a pained whine, its head coming between Eka's hands.
  & "I won't be far, just listen for me," Eka said, fingers brushing the contours of the {{hyroo}}'s large parabolic ears. Hush yielded then, letting out a yip and taking Lupin's side.
  & Eka smirked, and turned to the orange hound. "Let's get going!"
  & Both walked out of the tent and proceeded into the desert wilds, the wind was down, and the suns were extra hot. The leaf hound followed Eka closely, well-aware of the existence of a secret piece of nuni, hidden anyway in the palm of Eka's hand. Leaf hounds had a keen sense of smell, this particular one was dying to get at this last bit of nuni goodness, and would keep close as if to make sure no one else would get it. 
  & Gradually, the point of colour expanded into a row of trees, and beyond that, was a vast hollow in the ground. At its center, was an islet of greenery interspersed with patches of colour, each colour corresponding to a different crop. There was no way that this place had come into being on its own, this improbable oasis was the work of a devoted carer. Looking further, Eka glimpsed a few of those horrible {{floater}}s hovering around the green piece of land. It seemed impossible to near it without them noticing, if one of them did, without Hush or Lupin around to help, they would be in trouble. The orange hound seemed calm, not the least bit bothered by their presence. It was clear that it had come through here, and yet, had not suffered any harm from those winged monsters. Had they not seen the hound? Maybe it knew of a way inside, one unseen by them. Eka's eyes were fixed on any movement in the oasis, there were many other leaf hounds there, one of them was chasing a {{floater}} that had wandered a bit too far inland. The {{floater}} turned yellow and backed away, returning to the outer edges. 
  & Eka had an idea then, the leaf hound was their key to the oasis, and the morsel of nuni, was the enabler.
  & The red head returned to camp, the faithful leaf hound trailing behind, using the nuni as a lure was brilliant, Eka thought. They would make their way inside with the hound, drawn close by the irresistible allure of the yellow tuber, and thusly, keep the {{floater}}s away. They feared the orange guardians. Hopefully, this hound was frightful enough to protect all 3 of them and grant them safe passage. All was packed away, the injured Verido was secured onto Hush and the group then marched towards the oasis. They stood at the edge of it, Lupin opened one fatigued eye, "Eka no- we can't."
  & “It’s okay, we’ve got a guide this time,” their fleshy guide was at their side, mouth dripping with clear juices. The last bit of nuni in hand, Eka's foot came to press on the carpet of grass, the spheres raced over but did not attack, not while the orange mutt was there. Eka gave the hound half of the piece of nuni, it swallowed it whole and waited for the rest. They began to walk further into the oasis, the spheres had all gathered there, skin switching from red, to orange and back to yellow. Lupin was hiding under the fabric of the chute, dubious about the whole idea. To their amazement, the round creatures stared, but did not try anything. They walked further inland, to a point they knew would be free of the threat of those things. The other hounds in the oasis looked at them, their cheeks puffing up, holding back their bark. Though none made a sound, one of their kin was leading them in, and so they concluded that they weren't a threat. Lupin breathed a sigh of relief, and Eka offered the rest of the nuni to the hound, caressing its head “Good, good hound!”
  & Then, they noticed shouting from the house up the hill, one that in all this excitement, they had failed to notice. A dark-faced creature, wearing a patchwork of clothes came running, brandishing a rake. “How did you get past the hounds?!” But then, all was made clear: Waldek, the round hound, was eating a nuni. “Waldek, your insatiable hunger has doomed us all,” Waldek panted happily and wandered off, nose to the ground, searching for more food.
  & The creature before them now, was a Terin, dark-skinned and dark-haired, two-toed and endowed with thick limbs. A large rimmed hat shieled the wearer from the sun, a hate made from banabo leaves, secured to the head with a cloth, running along the top of the hat and tied under the chin. 
  & Eka stared at the rake-wielding farmer, "I love your green place!". 
  & {{Zucca}} was so furious that these words fell on deaf ears. "Leave at once! This is my property!” the owner of the oasis said, pushing Eka back with the tip of a rake. {{hyroo}} growled and {{Zucca}} jumped backwards, rake and all. "A {{hyroo}}?" {{Zucca}} said, eyes aglow, "such creatures are rare, very few were grown. {{hyroo}}s need lots of moisture, a temperate climate to sprout! How is this possible?" This was a creature of the old world, {{Zucca}} thought the {{hyroo}}s had died with it.
  & Eka could see the farmer's fascination for Hush, but right now they had more pressing matters, “those things out there attacked us, my friends are hurt."
  & "There has been talk of receding genes... sprouts hibernating in the soil and awaiting the proper conditions to sprout, yes, this is what must have happened-" {{Zucca}} paused, a frown replacing the expression of wonder, "staying here? Impossible!” Those words seemed forced. This fascination with {{hyroo}}s came attached with a string of complications: more time with the {{hyroo}}, meant more time with other people - strange people. Curiosity and fear were at war with each other inside {{Zucca}}'s head, but the battle was lost before it even began. "You'll have to go somewhere else," and with these words, came the death of curiosity.
  & Eka removed the scarf, revealing a red mane of hair, “time, shelter and medicine in exchange for 3 questions about Hush."
  & "How do I know you'll answer truthfully?" {{Zucca}} spat out.
  & "You can trust me."
  & {{Zucca}} was busy inspecting the red head's features carefully. The Terin then froze, eyes wide upon noticing the creature's vibrant hair, those eyes, and those same rounded ears. The Terin was deep in thought and spoke in a quiet voice. “Same... but different.” Dirty digits scratched at the wood of the rake, nails brown with soil, there were bits of it on the clothes too. The dark-skinned creature then glanced over at a pale Lupin, the Terin put a hand to the Verido's face. "Umph-" {{Zucca}} said, pulling away, "your friend had another accident, before this one I mean."
  & Eka nodded. "Yea, fell off an Ilk."
  & "Well, that explains it. No Verido in their right mind would choose to leave an Ilk... and before that?"
  & Eka shrugged. "I wasn't there before that, but now that I think of it, my friend is very... accident prone. Not a lot of world experience, if you know what I mean."
  & {{Zucca}} took a deep breath. "You can stay, but you can’t wander around my grounds without me saying so, and you can’t touch ANYTHING unless given to you. Is that clear?”
  & Eka nodded in thanks, Lupin breathed out a thank you as well. The injured Verido was sweating profusely, eyelids appeared heavy, drawn down by tiny invisible hands. 
  & "I want to eat a {{pomparu}} fart-flavored sponge cake on my next green day-" Lupin said.
  & Eka was concerned. "Oh oh, my friend is delusional. I need some {{medililly}} herbs to treat the wounds, and fast!"
  & {{Zucca}} promised to bring some over later. "Don’t. Touch. Anything.” After this, the grouch returned to the house atop the hill.
  & Eka looked pleased. If one took note of the subtleties in {{Zucca}}'s mannerisms and speech, they would conclude that the Terin was a mess of   contradictory emotions; a reluctant, overprotective and intermittently sympathetic character. Staying here, meant that they would have to   respect the rules of the oasis and its master. 
  > <hr/>
  & Eka raised their tent, helped Lupin inside and sat down to watch the orange dogs walking the fields: they looked at every single crop, their antennae prodding them gently, as if they were asking them of their health. The oasis was divided into many parts, the front consisted of   fresh produce, like karrots and {{bam}}s. Fields of teaweet and other grains sat in between the vegetables and the small cabin atop the hill. Eka could see a space contoured by tall hedges behind that, making it impossible to see what was inside. {{Zucca}} was a busy fellow, there was even a large building being constructed all the way on the northern edge of the field.
  & Waldek was around still, despite the absence of nuni. Perhaps its visit to their camp that morning, was due to curiosity, or maybe kindness. Maybe the hound knew of the attack, and had purposely come to lead them to a safe place. Eka visited the patients often, Hush was handling it well enough, although, it too, was not its usual self. Then {{Zucca}}’s gravelly voice sounded outside: “Hey-” there was a pause, they hadn't introduced each other by name yet, “—hey uh. Hey you, in the tent!"
  & Eka wandered out. "You can call me Eka, and that trumpet-eared invalid in there is Lew-pee-lew.”
  & “Lew-pee-lew huh? That sounds made up."
  & Eka nodded, "I'm sure you know how eccentric Veridos can be {{Zucca}}, you've heard the stories. Beads in their hair and all—”
  & "How do you know my name?!"
  & "Oh your hound Waldek told me. Well, through Hush because I don't speak {{leafhound}} – not well anyway, I always mix up the subtleties in the yaps. Don't get me started on the yips! It's a very tonal language you see, not easy to master, and there's so many dialects."
  & "I don't like lies, or jokes," {{Zucca}} began, "I'm going to apply your friend's medicine. I don't want to hear any more nonsense."
  & {{Zucca}} had two {{medililly}} poultices in hand, and applied one to Hush, and the other Lupin. The soft, moist mass was applied to the wounds and wrapped carefully with a clean strip of cloth.
  & "What is the name of mountain you spoke of, where the {{hyroo}}s grow? It's within the belt isn't it?" {{Zucca}} asked, eyes set on the Hush. The large-eared creature was asleep, coiled into a tight ball with its head hidden, its back expanded and contracted with every breath. {{Zucca}} put a hand to the {{hyroo}}'s side, inspecting its fur.
  & "It hasn't got one, places without names remain strangely unseen."
  & "You won't say," {{Zucca}} paused, "You think I'll tell? Whom shall I divulge this to I wonder?"
  & "I'm telling you the truth, it hasn't got one."
  & "Okay. Fine." {{Zucca}} was displeased with this answer. "How long do {{hyroo}}s live for?"
  & "A hundred years? Maybe?"
  & "-and how old is Hush?"
  & "Less than a year old i'd say. Hush is a very green sprout," saying this, Eka turned to caress the back of the {{hyroo}}. 
  & "They grow that big in just one year? Remarkable."
  & "That makes 3 questions!"
  & "No, no - that first one doesn't count. I didn't get an answer." {{Zucca}} said.
  & Eka thought about this for a moment, then shrugged, "okay. Fair enough. You get a redo."
  & {{Zucca}} nodded, before leaving the tent - that last question needed to be pondered carefully.
  & The next day, Hush had recovered and was sitting outside the tent with Waldek, gnawing on a stalk of gingin root. During the night, their leaf-tailed guide had rounded up a pile of fresh produce for them. {{Zucca}}’s words came to mind then: "Take only what is given to you." Eka smirked at this, the Terin hadn’t intended on Waldek bringing food over, but technically, they weren’t breaking any rules. The orange critter let out a yip before returning to its meal, it had helped itself to some of the items in the pile. Eka gathered some produce and began to cook breakfast.

  & “I present you toast! Eka style!” Eka said, presenting this tasty creation to the bed-bound Verido.
  & Lupin was awake, and was looking much better than yesterday, “whoa fresh mapples! Surprised {{Zucca}} let you take them.” With eyes now closed, the patient took a bite - as if the momentary absence of one sense could heighten another.
  & “Was a gift from our pal Waldek - our little secret! OH you’re going to love this place Lew! It’s abundant with greens and oranges and purples and-”
  & Yesterday, Lupin had been too sick to really take in the details of the oasis, but now, beyond the fragrant poetry of the mapple toast, the nose detected hints of sweet norcorn and teaweet in the air. These smells, in turn, summoned an approximation of what the oasis looked like in Lupin's brain.
  & "-and blues!"
  & “Looking forward to seeing that," Lupin said with a smile, before taking note of the poultice, "thanks for taking care of me."
  & “{{Zucca}} made that poultice for you though, that's what healed you up."
  & “I’ll give {{Zucca}} my thanks.”
  & “You'd better! {{medililly}} takes ages to grow, was kind of our host to spare some,” Eka said.
  & After their meal, they removed the poultice and checked the wound; the inflammation was down. Hush was in perfect health and walked around the tent, cheeks full of food. A stomach full of fresh, colourful food may have played a part in its recovery. 
  & Later that afternoon, they heard the farmer yelling. When they peered through the opening of the tent, they could see the Terin chasing pale winged insects out of the field, "get out of my property!” But these creatures, yielded not to these demands. 
  & Eka wandered out of the tent, “whats going on?” {{Zucca}} jumped in surprise, it was likely that their host had forgotten there were others here, “oh! You have mosslings in your produce!”
  & “Can’t get rid of em’. They hate lemone grass so I planted some around to keep them away, but I’m beginning to think they’ve developed a taste for it. They're like super mosslings. Curse these things! They make everything rot.”
  & Lupin sat in front of the tent, sipping tea, at peace and content despite the ever present chest pains. The oasis had a voice all its own, speaking through the rustling of the various plants in the field - a concerto of greenery. There was not many around to listen, a handful of hounds, the caretaker, Eka... it occurred to the Verido then, that there wasn’t anyone else here, and that this large orchestra of an oasis sang for too few - surely it deserved a larger public. They were producing all of this food for themselves, no one else was here to eat it - that is, unless there was a village of tiny people over there in that modest-sized house. Lupin tried to bring up the topic later that day, when tasked with peeling {{bam}}s for tonight’s dinner, Eka too, thought it strange.
  & “Let’s ask the vegetables,” Eka set the peeled {{bam}}s down in a pot and wandered over to the fields. The red head stopped where {{Zucca}} had been earlier that day, to that mossling-infested karrot head, and tried to pose it a question: “what’s the deal with this {{Zucca}} fellow anyway?”
  & Lupin watched from afar. “Stop it. You do not speak vegetable."
  & Eka replied with a shush! Loud voices may incite the ill-tempered landlord to come back over here again with that rake. After laying an ear against the side of the karrot, Eka waited for an answer, “oh! A secret you say?”
  & Lupin watched, resisting the urge to ask about what the karrot was saying, asking would mean giving into this prank; but then again, Eka knew a lot about the world, perhaps there was such a thing as vegetable tongue. A language that could not be spoken with words; but with light, or vibrations. After a short conversation, the vegetable whisperer rose and wandered back over to Lupin. There was some silence, but it did not last. “What did it say?”
  & “It said, that there is something valuable here-” saying this, Eka covered those ruby eyes with two hands and uncovered them just as quickly, "-hidden away."
  & That got the Verido's attention, “valuable? You mean like a treasure?”
  & “Like a secret,” Eka corrected, pressing the point of a finger hard on Lupin's nose. Then, the peeling of the {{bam}}s continued, tonight's dinner was {{bam}} soup with slices of muckwheat bread. The idea of a secret was intriguing, but it was probably false.
  & That night the Verido could not sleep, haunted by the idea of a treasure. It wasn't interesting because of its potential value, but because of the air of mystery that came with it. If there was a secret, it would be around the house, that whole area looked very sheltered and private. It was likely that {{Zucca}} did have something hidden over there.
  > <hr/>
  & The next day, Lupin was feeling much better and got up before the sun. {{Zucca}} was awake too, standing way out there in the fields, tending to the crops and far too busy to notice anyone else there. Lupin knew better than to break into someone’s home, and decided to circle it, hopefully this would satiate the Verido's curiosity. Upon arriving on the eastern side of it, a hedge blocked the way, the area at the back of the house was surrounded with it. Lupin put an arm in it, to see if it was as thick as it looked. There were noises nearby just then, Waldek was standing close, but had not yet alerted their host.
  & “Such a good guard hound! We’re friends aren’t we? You’re not going to tell on me are you?” Lupin said in a hushed voice, stuck halfway into the big hedge, scarf and hair caught up into the branches. Waldek let out a bark, and then another. Getting out of the mass of shrubbery was harder than getting in, its branches curled inwards and refused to let go. It was decided then, that forward was better, better than facing an angry {{Zucca}}. The Verido popped out of the other side, clothes full of leaves and bits of branches. A person-shaped hole was there, a weird, not-quite triangular outline that made the hedge look like it was in mid-cry. This inoffensive excursion around {{Zucca}}'s house had turned into a break-in, "The branches of the shrub and its curly fingers made me do it," was hardly an excuse. Lupin could not accuse the karrot either, blaming the words of a vegetable would do no one any good. Also, one had to remember that if the root veggie could speak, its mossling-infected mind would be susceptible to telling untruths. 
  & “What am I doing.” The Verido took a step back, but another orange dog began to bark and growl from inside the compound. Lupin kept as far   away from the hound as the hedge permitted, and in this instant, gazed upon a most wonderful sight: there was a vast field, contoured by a   tall fence of greenery. There was music playing, a soft tune, consisting of bells and whistles. Then a thing most noteworthy came into view, on the ground, just a short meter away, was a leafling.
  & The reason the hound was so miffed, was because this intruder had almost crushed it, "oh hey I’m sorry.” The hound's antennae ears caressed  the leafling gently, all was well, its protector was content. Although it did not approve of the intruder's proximity, and with a push of the nose, nudged Lupin away from the field. This place was full of fragile leaflings, rows of little green nubs pushing out of the soil. Some of the leaves had different shapes, others, bore other colours along with the base green. This place, was a nursery.
  & Lupin had seen nurseries before, they had a small one in Volare. At most, Volare had 2 leaflings growing at once - this place had many more. The presence of a nursery this size, justified the need for a large and reliable food source. {{Zucca}} had planted enough leaflings here to   populate a small city. After circling the field, under the watchful eye of the hound, Lupin moved closer to the house to look at a calendar on a wall, marked with the possible harvesting dates. There were bags of grained food, as well as a giant basin made of rock with a large flat-headed hammer of matching size. This is where the grains were ground-up, made small for tiny mouths to chew. All was planned ahead for the coming of the younglings. Lupin ran a hand along the insides of the bowl, and tasted some remnants of the grain in it. "Granulated teaweet berries," teaweet was a widely consumed grain, but this teaweet was different. It had a strong aroma and tasted sweet, clean and fresh. {{Zucca}} and the hounds were skilled at farming, that much was clear, no one else could produce such sweet-tasting teaweet. 
  & In Volare, the grain was bland and needed to be augmented with spices. Adding spices to something as perfect as these grains would be   criminal, they had no need of it. Lost in thought, Lupin had only just noticed a figure moving inside the house. It was time to leave, the   Verido hurried back towards the bushes. Precipitated by the fear of being discovered, in a clumsy fashion, dirt was kicked over footprints and branches were scattered about in a seemingly natural way. There was no time to make peace with the shrub, Lupin pushed through the dense thicket and emerged on the other side. The Verido then hurried back to camp, to tell Eka of this discovery.
  > <hr/>
  & “You do realize I was making fun of you last night. {{Zucca}} does have a secret though, that much is clear,” Eka said.
  & Lupin didn’t care about that, “There’s a nursery in there! Full of tiny people like we said!" Then came a description of the place, how it was encircled by hedges, the stone bowl, immeasurable bags of grain, the rows and rows of leaflings... the Verido paused then, “think {{Zucca}}'s raising an army?”
  & Eka laughed at this, “definitely. They'll be carving swords from karrots, and helmets from hollowed-out kappages. A veil of teaweet arrows will blot out the sun!"
  & Just then, they heard barking outside. The hounds may have been chasing away yet another {{floater}}, but they heard strange voices. Then, came {{Zucca}}'s scratchy throat organ, “get off my land!”
  & Lupin and Eka poked their heads out of their tent to look at the scene outside: {{Zucca}} had that trusty rake in hand, and was accompanied by a collection of hounds. A covered wagon pulled by a vennec stood at the edge of the oasis, the 3 passengers were speaking to {{Zucca}}. They were covered in layers of light fabric, to shield their skin from the sun and sand no doubt.
  & "You need to leave!" {{Zucca}} screamed at them.
  & One of the travellers went to grab an empty sac of grains from the wagon to show that they were in dire need of supplies.
  & “Travellers,” Lupin whispered to Eka.
  & But still, {{Zucca}} yelled for them to leave, caring little for reasons and pleas for aid, "you have 10 seconds to leave this place, there will be consequences!"
  & Another traveler, depleted of energy, could not stand for this, "You would let us die then?"
  & Some of {{Zucca}}'s hounds let out a growl and charged forward to get them to back away, they had been taught well, if they sensed anger they had  been instructed to attack. The travellers knew nothing of leaf hounds, all they saw were teeth. They pulled out, for protection, what looked like short pikes from the inside of their robes. Again, the hounds had been trained to retaliate when threatened with objects. The leafy caretakers could be quite mean if they wanted to, they bared their pearly whites and bit at their legs and in the wood of their weapons. {{Zucca}} reached into a side pouch, pulled out a handful of green herbs and tossed it towards the attackers. The hounds pulled away, just as the {{floater}}s came rushing in, attracted by the scent. The red spherical parasites chased after the intruders, now covered in those herbs. 
  & Lupin watched, cringing as multiple {{floater}}s latched onto the skin of the smallest of the group, while the others tried to get them off their friend using their pikes, which upon close inspection, would be revealed to be simple broomsticks. The victim fell on the ground, screaming for aid, the end of the broomsticks did little to help given the gooey construct of these animals. Lupin’s heart ached, something had to be done. The verido turned to Eka, but the red head was already gone.
  & Eka was riding Hush and grabbed the collar of the injured. They jumped up high into the sky, like they’d done before to get rid of the   {{floater}}s. Altitude and cold, two things they knew repelled the spheres. The other two travellers had boarded their wagon and were running   away, urging their vennec forward, thankfully they had been spared. 
  & {{Zucca}} did not fail to see that Eka was helping them, angry eyes moved to judge Lupin next, “you’re with them aren’t you!? They sent you ahead didn’t they? I trusted you!” The leaf hounds were manning the edge of the oasis, while the master of this green land strode over to the tent towards Lupin. With surprising speed and abruptness, {{Zucca}} flipped the rake around to show another more pointy end, and aimed it for the Verido's throat. Lupin did not move, having no desire to upset their host further.
  & “You CAN trust me {{Zucca}}!”
  & “Then why’s your friend helping them?” {{Zucca}} spat, pressing the point against soft skin.
  & “Because Eka is kind.” Lupin stayed perfectly still, uncertain if {{Zucca}} would believe it, or purposely choose to ignore the words.
  & {{Zucca}} must have known the Verido wasn’t lying, because those lips found no suitable rebuttal; though there was an air of suspicion in those eyes still. “What about you? Are you kind Lew-pee-lew?”
  & Lupin nearly laughed at this; Eka liked to give people ridiculous nicknames, but this jest was ill-timed. This situation was delicate, a laugh would be most unwelcome, and most unwise. “I like to think I am, yes. And if you don't mind, I'd rather you call me Lupin."
  & {{Zucca}}'s face was warped with rage, “I bet you like to think that you’re a truth-sayer too? You were in my nursery today, don’t deny it I know you were there! What did you see? You stole from me didn't you?”
  & Lupin knew it was dumb to think that their host wouldn’t find out about that visit to the nursery earlier, only a person without sight could have missed that large person-shaped hole in the hedge. “I took nothing.”
  & “Im sick of you people! Coming in here, feigning kindness to steal from me!”
  & Lupin was afraid of what {{Zucca}} would do in this heightened state. Just then, Eka landed back in the oasis with Hush, and the injured traveler. “Why did you bring that filth back in here?!” {{Zucca}}'s voice was becoming shrill with fury.
  & “We need to care for these wounds," Eka said, speaking low and slow, holding up the injured traveler. 
  & Speaking in a tranquil manner did not help to suppress {{Zucca}}'s growing resentment though. “I made a mistake letting you come in here-” a hand dove into the side pouch, Lupin remembered this from before. That pouch was full of herbs, something the {{floater}}s could not resist, just a bit of it in the air and these things would come rushing. 
  & Before {{Zucca}} could do it, Lupin grabbed the Terin's arm, "Don't do it!" Eka stepped in as well, a hand set on the pouch of herbs; yet another obstacle.
  & “That’s sweet grass-” the red head said, catching the scent of it, "-the {{floater}}s like sweet grass.”
  & {{Zucca}} couldn’t push Eka away, those ruby eyes had a soothing quality to them, “Y-yes. It is." Both learned then that the valley around the   oasis was full of patches of sweet grass, planted there with purpose, to attract the {{floater}}s and to keep people away; but the creatures ate it up so fast, the keeper of the oasis always had to plant more. Because they had a dependable source of food, the {{floater}}s became greedy, and even more territorial. {{Zucca}} had gone through a lot of trouble, to keep this place hidden.
  & The injured traveler could not believe that the Terin was responsible for these {{floater}}s being here, “you’ve been feeding those things? You   know how many of us they’ve hurt?”
  & “You think I don’t know?!” {{Zucca}}'s voice adopted a deep, menacing tone. The caretaker looked tired of fighting and arguing. “I take no   pleasure in hurting others, I really don’t. I just don’t have the energy to keep intruders away on my own, I don’t have many hounds left   anymore-” saying this, these yellow eyes saddened, they had endured much pain in the past. {{Zucca}} loved the leaf hounds deeply, Eka could tell.   
  & They convinced their host to let them heal the traveler - that they came to know as Laris - and that they would keep watch. It was   uncharacteristic of the Terin to trust strangers in this way, to allow them to tend to yet, another stranger. Eka inspired confidence. It was also because of the round ears, people with round ears, according to this Terin, were not known to lie.
  > <hr/>
  & That night, from their encampment in the oasis, they could see that the vennec-pulled wagon was still out there. A fire danced in the   distance, signalling their presence. Eka had sent the woth over, to instruct the other travellers to stay close and to make no attempt to come to the oasis. This, with the promise that their friend would be cared for, and returned to them the next day. The woth had returned to the oasis to inform them that the message had been delivered, "thank you tumbleweed," but alas, the woth did not answer to that name and went to rest inside of its glass house. {{Zucca}}, Lupin, Eka and the patient were in the tent. The terin did not trust anyone on this property, and had decided not to rest until all had gone. The wounded traveler had quieted, poultices lay over the injuries, Eka had learned the recipe just by smell alone, and made the medicine using herbs that Waldek had once again, secretly provided.
  & Lupin's eyes wandered over to {{Zucca}}. “All they want is food. Surely you can spare some?”
  & {{Zucca}} was busy filling a pipe with fresh bonan leaves, after lighting it the terin took a few puffs, the whole tent was soon filled with the smell of bonan. “They never just want food.”
  & The Verido looked puzzled, "how do you mean?”
  & "Land, food, and seeds."
  & "The sproutlings-" Lupin said in a low voice, but {{Zucca}} had seen the word on those lips.
  & "What made you trespass into my home Lupin?"
  & "You have so much produce, more than enough to feed yourself and those hounds for years. I just wanted to understand. Besides, you can't know that people will want more, the travellers just wanted help."
  & "You're right, I can't know. So i prefer to assume that they're false, it's safer for me and the sproutlings. I've had too many deceivers   here, too many to count." {{Zucca}} sucked at the pipe, smoke pushing out of these nostrils.
  & Eka looked at {{Zucca}}, “there are so few of you left.”
  & The Terin took another long puff from the pipe, before exhaling again, “we have the Iridi to thank for that.”
  > <hr/>
  & {_The Raids_}
  & The {{Iridi}} were a strong nation, they had built a foundry in the mountains of {{mount Nui}} and had developed much industry as a result. They had many craftsmen, and plenty of fertile land, and so the population grew large. When they discovered the {{chloromyce shroos}} underground, they began to harvest them and centred their very way of life around them. They trained foot soldiers, and sent them out into the world to find more mining sites. They happened upon other villages, captured them for their own and forced them to dig underground for the famed fungi. One of the taken cities, was {{Ministe}}, the Terin capital. The city was overrun with soldiers, many escaped, but most were not prepared for the challenges of nomadic-living. They found shelter in other villages, but the shock of losing one's home resulted in many suffering from {{Bou}}ts of listless depression. The workforce was severely reduced, leaving very few to continue to work the earth to feed its people. To make things worse, the few villages left standing became overcrowded. People were forbidden from planting their young; but it was just as well, malnutrition was rampant and not many could not produce healthy seeds.
  & This lasted a long while, by then the Iridi had a steady flow of chloromyce shroos, but the reigning monarch Moera wished for a more efficient system. The slaves were difficult and often, non-cooperative. The monarch decided that they would have to grow their own slaves instead, only then, would they be fully submissive. 
  & Another issue was the matter of seeds, the Iridi, as proud as they were, did not wish to use their own. {{Zucca}}, along with a handful of other Terins, built the {{Suvalba Sanctuary}} for sproutlings where a parent could come and sow their young in a protected environment. A group of Iridi soldiers got word of it, they raided the place and took all of the seedlings. This was what the crown was seeking: unspoiled slaves. The resident Terins were captured, brought into the mines of {{Irideri}} to assist in growing the children, all but {{Zucca}}. {{Zucca}} escaped with a collection of seeds, and some of the resident leaf hounds. Losing so many was hard, the parents had trusted them with their seedlings. Terins weren’t soldiers, they could not fend away the attackers. {{Zucca}} suspected that it had been a Terin that had leaked the information, a lot of them had turned to vice after the fall of their home land. For many, life just wasn't worth living.
  & {{Zucca}} protected the seeds and searched for a place to start anew, somewhere far and hidden. A tall stranger from the desert, told of a place that was still invisible to the world and that could host such a project. Depleted of strength and energy, {{Zucca}} followed the stranger's instructions and found a great recess in the land, surrounded by large canopied trees. This was no mirage, but a miraculous remnant of the old world - or so, {{Zucca}} thought. The trees would protect the new sanctuary from sand dunes shifting in high winds, and from the eyes of curious onlookers. In the hollow, after much digging, the Terin uncovered a boundless waterstone pit. The component in the sands caused the water to pearl up into these soft, but palpable shapes. Waterstone pits this size were rare, a rarity these days, the stranger must have known of it.
  & The path to creating a green land was not an easy one, the soft dunes made it hard to stay atop the sand, it was an exhausting endeavour. The Terin worked long and hard at making the soil fertile. The hounds helped with the work and together, they planted more {{leafhound}} saplings, they would need more workers to build a new sanctuary. It took many years to make the land green; soil was turned, a house was built for the infants to grow in. With a stable food supply, would come the time to plant seeds. This would take many more years to accomplish, given the state of the desert.
  & The Iridi might have expanded much further, if it hadn't been for the loss of their sovereign. No one knows what happened, but it was enough to stop the armies from advancing further. The next monarch put a stop to it, with plenty of slaves at hand they stopped the raids and closed the kingdom to the world.
  & With the threat of the Iridi now gone, {{Zucca}} felt at peace. People began to travel again and happened by the oasis often. The Terin was glad to part with food to help them on their journey, but demanded they keep the place a secret. They must have told others, because soon, more began to show. Some came making ridiculous demands, others wanted the land for their own, the rest were there to steal seeds. The population of the world was dwindling, {{Zucca}} had been away for some time and didn't know how bad things were out there. It was the duty of a Terin to help, but there was the fear that the seeds would not be taken care of, many did not know how to sow life.
  & {{Zucca}} was attacked many times, but the hounds were there to ward off attackers. Many were lost, and so the Terin began to spread false rumours of the valley. If others believed it to be dangerous, maybe they would go out of their way to avoid it. The planting of sweet grass was another attempt at keeping people away. The {{floater}}s did a fair job of keeping intruders at bay, the Terin did not like to harm others but knew no other way, to keep the seedlings safe. {{Zucca}} always imagined that when the leaflings would grow, walk, and talk, that they would be sent out back into the world. Their knowledge and skills would save the land. Lupin couldn’t imagine {{Zucca}} taking care of so many infants."
  > <hr/>
  & The next day, {{Zucca}} allowed Eka and Lupin to view the nursery, while Hush and the hounds had been left in charge of the patient in the tent. Everyone on this planet was born from the earth, from seeds. A willing, and healthy parent could sow a seed, eventually the seed would grow into a sproutling; this could take a long time, depending on the state of the soil and temperature. Some races could only sprout in the dark, others in high-moisture environments; even altitude played a part in the growing process. Come time for harvesting, the sproutlings would be taken out of the ground, the roots severed, and they would be put into the hands of a carer - often, a Terin. During the first days of life, the younglings needed protection and good nutrition to thrive. The leaves on their heads too would fall, in time, and like the roots, left no mark behind. The young grew fast, and even faster in good conditions.
  & {{Zucca}} pointed to the markings in Lupin’s face, “those lines you wear are a remnant of when everyone lived in the wilds. The Verido didn't have colour on their faces then, the colour segregation of your people is unfortunate Lupin, I rather liked the subtleties of the patterns from before - like veins on a leaf. Colors are vulgar."
  & Lupin wasn’t sure what to say, looking at the patterns on these arms in silent embarrassment. The Verido recalled when these patterns were coloured in blue - a painful process. The people of Volare were proud of it, it was a tribute to Vol, their carrier and protector who bore this colour in its hairs. The festivities around this event were extravagant, everyone in the city was there and prepared food and activities: Looma root pies, glider races, whistling contests etc. For Lupin, the party was even more grandiose, given the relation to Volare. Now, thinking of it, perhaps these colours did serve to separate their people - no other race did this. 
  & Eka put a hand on Lupin’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze.
  & "It looks nice blue," saying this, before ruffling up that pale head of hair; thusly, ridding the Verido of this unnecessary shamefacedness.
  & {{Zucca}} went on to explain that bearing seeds was a complicated matter, anyone, after a certain age, could start bearing seeds. Though not all would sprout younglings, these were ground-up into fodder for other seeds for nourishment. Events of the world also made seed-bearing difficult, a hungry and tired person would produce nothing at all. Greenery too was a rarity, as were good planting grounds, for this reason many simply stopped sowing. For the better part of history, Terins were responsible for keeping a steady, and healthy growth of leaflings. This dependence on outside help, is the main cause for the world's depopulation problem. {{Levi}} had spoken of a Terin living in Volare, that cared for the seedlings, but this was long ago. Growing up, the Verido had no memory of a Terin living amongst them, this raised many questions, did the elders do away with this practice?
  & "Have you ever planted one of yours?" Lupin asked.
  & {{Zucca}}'s face made it clear to Lupin that doing such a thing was unthinkable. "I owe it to all of the parents who entrusted us with their young to finish the work we started in the {{Suvalba Sanctuary}}. Planting my own? That would be selfish. These seedlings are my responsibility, their needs and safety are above my own. Rather die than to fail them in this."
  & Conversations with {{Zucca}} always seemed to take a dark turn somehow, it would always end with Lupin feeling terrible. Eka had wandered to another part of the nursery, accompanied by Waldek who was excited to show how big the leaflings in the northern end of the field had become. Eka's presence usually helped to keep dark thoughts a good distance away, now thoughts of Volare, of {{Levi}}, being Voice - all of that, was re-surfacing in this Verido's mind. 
  & "I don't really want to sow seeds either-" Lupin said to {{Zucca}}, eyes on a leafling, part of a row reserved for {{Aodal}} sprouts. "My reasons are selfish. I've always had pressure to do it. Because of my connection with the Ilk and to Volare it was always expected of me. I would have to sow a seed, to raise another Voice. It's kind of a big deal. Now that I've gone, my branch of the family has ended - I feel bad to say it, but I'm sort of... relieved."
  & "Don't dwell on it, it's for the best. You would make a terrible Mapa," {{Zucca}} admitted, looking at the leaves of a nearby leafling.
  & Lupin laughed at this. {{Zucca}}'s honesty was brutal at times, but correct in this case. "Yea - I think so too."
  > <hr/>
  & Lupin returned to the tent in the afternoon, to check on their patient. Laris was awake, though weak still. “You live here?” Laris asked.
  & “Just passing through.”
  & “You should help us-” the patient sat up, despite the wounds being fresh. A pair of hands shot forward and grabbed onto Lupin's, slippery palms, wet with sweat. Laris said it again, but with more confidence this time, "-you will help us." It was more of a demand then a suggestion, from here, the Verido could make out hints of jade amongst the red streaking those gleaming, gelatinous orbs.
  & “To do what exactly?” Lupin wanted to look away, but couldn't do it, it would be rude to do so.
  & “We're starving, we need supplies if we hope to make it back to Kippu."
  & "I'm sure we can convince {{Zucca}} to part with a few items."
  & "That would be wonderful." Laris began to relax, releasing the Verido and melting back into the bed. "So you've been here a while then? You've seen the nursery?"
  & “Why do you ask?” Lupin replied, unsure if it was a good idea to speak of this.
  & "Sproutlings are such a rarity these days, I'm of bearing age but it just isn't working out you know? It's probably for the best, I can barely feed myself. Don't you think it cruel to create more life in such times?"
  & Lupin knew why Laris couldn't bear seeds, it was probably due to some deficiencies. "Ill have a talk with {{Zucca}}. I promise."
  & Laris smiled at this, and drifted off to sleep.
  & Lupin felt terrible, and decided on going to speak with {{Zucca}} again. This time, the front gate, rather than the bushes, was used as means of entry. The Terin was in the nursery feeding the seedlings, crushing wet stones over each one. The stones lay folded into an apron, it was a lot of weight to carry, this worker did not shy away from laborious tasks, especially if small lives depended on it.
  & “Can't you give them supplies?” Lupin regretted the abruptness of the question, but didn’t know how else to ask.
  & {{Zucca}} continued to work, “What did the vagabond tell you hm?”
  & Laris, it seemed, would always be a fiend in the Terin's eyes, but this didn't deter Lupin. “The same thing they told you, they're hungry.”
  & "And like I told all of you, this is about more than food."
  & Lupin wished for a way to communicate these thoughts better, "you can't be sure of that! You may very well kill them if you don't help, this is what I know."
  & “Dying, yes. That may be true, but that's only because they spend all their time begging for food. They should try gardening, instead of   living off of others like parasites.”
  & “I thought you cared about all life,” Lupin said, sourly.
  & “I do!" {{Zucca}} replied, irritated by all of these accusations. "I'll give them food and they'll ask to stay the night, then they'll ask to see the nursery. The nursery makes people lose their minds, many feel that the world has too many unfed mouths. Mouths. What of minds? I'll teach the young ones how to provide for themselves, how to sow and care for food - you know, everyone wants to live in a field but no one wants to break their backs working the soil, they want the comforts and conveniences of a city while people like me do all of the grubby work. That's all anyone ever cares about." {{Zucca}}'s hands were gripping so hard at those waterstones that clear liquid was seeping out of the hard skins, from tiny cracks zigzagging on the sides. "I've seen it happen enough times to know, I may not look it but I have many years on me Lupin. The world has not turned me into a bitter old thing, I'm quite happy, but I can't abide lethargy." It's true that the Terin did not look old, though those hands were cracked with age and wear.
  & Lupin swallowed hard, {{Zucca}} was making a whole lot of assumptions about people, it was hardly fair. “Deficiencies and fear will do that to a person, you need to help them! You said it yourself, you'll teach the kids to care for themselves, why not teach travellers? Why keep those skills to yourself?”
  & “What would you have me do? Take care of a farm AND a school for inept gardeners? I've no time for it, and grown adults do not change their ways, they just don't. I'm living proof of it,” with this, Lupin was ordered away. This conversation was tiring, but soon the strangers would leave and take their questions and unpleasantries along with them. At least the hounds couldn't talk, and only yapped to report a problem. "You will leave with that vagrant tomorrow. I'll deal with my own problems. I always have."
  & "You've created all of these possibilities of things that could but may never happen. It's unfair. I'm sure you can all live here together happily. You'll need help to raise all those sproutlings, just give them a chance," Lupin insisted, in a near-begging tone.
  & {{Zucca}} eyes darkened then, lines formed in places where there had been none previously, like that mask of youth had suddenly cracked off. "I have no need of help. No need of it you hear?!" With this, the Terin disappeared inside the house and slammed the door to a close.
  & Lupin returned to the tent and retold everything that had happened, the conversation with Laris and the one with {{Zucca}}. All of it recounted in a voice most somber, it was the death of hope, the Verido wanted to help everyone but this was not possible. Sitting near the wonder offered no comfort today, Eka was running fingers over Laris's face. Even in sleep, the traveler looked worn-out, dark heavy crescents hanging under a set of puffy eyes. Lupin too, had a face fit for wear at a funeral. Eka threw an arm around the shoulder of this downhearted companion, and squeezed it tightly.
  & "{{Zucca}} wants us to leave," Lupin said, hurt by the Terin's indifference. Even Eka's presence did little to assuage this pain.
  & "Then, we will do as our host wants, we can't force anyone's hand-" Eka replied. "You know, back in the old days Terins used to do check-ups on the Ilk. They did this during their yearly stops, back when {{Mimed was still standing. The Voices would report to the Terins on the year, on the pains the Ilk may have mentioned. When {{Ministe}} fell, a Terin, Melanza, boarded the Ilk of Volare and taught your people how to care for Vol. Melanza helped to create the Hands, as you know them."
  & "Yes, I remember that. {{Maliss}} learned a lot from Melanza, especially for the nursery. We had population problems then, but not since."
  & Eka nodded. "Terins can see sickness and health in others, its second nature. They're the carers of the world."
  & Lupin swallowed hard then. "When the carers are near-extinct, as they are now... what does that say of the state of the world?"
  & "Get some rest Lew." Eka said with a smile, "It's late."
  & All went to sleep, all, but Laris who had overheard their conversation. In the night, the patient left the sick bed and marched over to the house atop the hill. The strong scent of those poultices covered up all smells and so the hounds did not sense the stranger walking about, besides, all were tired after today's events. Laris pushed through the hedge, like Lupin had done, and arrived on the other side. Just ahead, slept row after row of sproutlings with green tops sticking out of the dirt. They looked beautiful there, lighted by the moonlights, casting the tiniest of shadows. To the person standing here now, this field was not a bringer of joy, but a thing of cruelty. This body had suffered much, a layer of skin spread thin over a skeleton, it never had the chance to thicken to better protect the fragile organs inside. Laris feared that these beautiful sprouts too, would suffer the same fate, that this land would not keep its promise and would not stay green. Panicked hands dove into the dirt, fingers wrapping tightly around the stem of a sproutling. "You will not suffer as I have, I wont allow it," Laris said, getting ready to pull.
  > <hr/>
  & Some later hours, {{Zucca}} awoke to tend to the usual morning chores. Walking into the nursery, the Terin froze - Laris was sitting in the nursery, hands full of dirt and head hanging low.
  & "Wh-why are you here."
  & There was a long silence, but eventually, Laris spoke up. "I wanted to rip out every single one. To spare them of all misery, but I couldn't - I couldn't do it."
  & {{Zucca}} stepped forward and frantically began to look around to make sure that all of the sproutlings were safe. Laris had done nothing, but the mere presence of another in this place was frightful still. Nurseries were delicate, and reacted strongly to their environment. Under stress, sproutlings could grow up to be anxious creatures, and if they suffered harm whilst still in the ground they could have deformities. Though despite this person being here, none of them looked stressed, as if they knew that they would not be harmed. The terin was relieved, and could resume breathing again. {{Zucca}} grabbed hold of the intruder's arm, but the fingers noticed a strange texture under them. Right there, on Laris' arm, was a food stamp.
  & {{Zucca}} looked at Laris. "You've been living off of this crap?"
  & Upon close inspection, there were other food stamps scattered about this stranger's skin; all expired, all sucked dry of their nutrients. The Terin sighed and took a seat down in the mud, in-between rows of greening leaves, and began to peel the stamps off one by one. Like a {{leafhound}} searching for parasites on a plant, {{Zucca}}'s fingers searched around for stamps, "no one ever tell you you can't live off stamps? What a ridiculous invention, these are no substitute for real food." The Terin was gentle, even if the face betrayed other emotions. The sproutlings really could sense anger in a voice, the gentle carer did not wish to trouble them with it and kept calm.
  & This tranquility surprised Laris, and despite being handled by gentle caring hands these limbs could not stop trembling. "Everyone in {{Montore}} uses these."
  & "These-" {{Zucca}} began, removing, yet another stamp "-are expired. They provide some nutrition when fresh but not like this."
  & Laris's eyes became wet with tears, "the crew of a passing Beobug {{sandfin}} sold us a crate-full." It was evident that these desert travellers were the unfortunate victims of a scam.
  & During yesterday's events, blind with rage, {{Zucca}} had failed to notice how thin Laris was. Not just this, the arms were not the same length, one was visibly shorter, and even the ears bore the same unevenness. During growth, maybe someone had stepped over Laris and caused these deformities, not everyone was lucky enough to be born in a sheltered place like this. This saddened {{Zucca}}, many years ago, the only joy to be had for a Terin was in keeping younglings healthy and safe. It was easy to forget that everyone was a sprout once, small and frail. The errors of others had turned this carer into a terrible grouch, and now these hands had hurt an innocent, a sprout that had long been ignored.
  & {{Zucca}} decided to sit on those feelings, there was no room for weak creatures in this world, and accompanied Laris out of the compound. They walked through the fields together, Laris glanced at the endless supply of produce, but did not ask for any, but did mention something else: "You have false-mosslings in your produce."
  & "What are you on about," {{Zucca}} said, hurrying ahead, this little walk was painful enough.
  & "False-mosslings. They mimic mosslings, they have curly antennae, and are impervious to lemone grass. They hate mepperpint. Read that in a book once."
  & At these words, {{Zucca}} froze in mid-step, but then shrugged it off. Both continued to walk in silence, to the encampment where the others travellers were. Two hounds had come along, to ensure their master's safety. They arrived at the wagon, the vennec raised its head and peered at the strangers, it became nervous at the sight of the hounds. The two travellers heard the cries of their friend, and moved out of the wagon to meet their visitors. Both were happy to see that Laris was safe and moved to meet their friend, they dared not to glance at {{Zucca}}, they had learned their lesson. Like Laris, the two there had uneven limbs, and the thinness of their skin was alarming. {{Zucca}} was embarrassed to stand there with a fleshy body, there are things that the Terin wanted to say, but it was too difficult. The travellers helped Laris onto the wagon, and urged the vennec onward. And so, these words were left unsaid, and the caretaker went back into the oasis with the hounds.
  & Eka and Lupin were awake, both were afraid for Laris when they'd noticed the bed was empty, but they saw the group leave in the distance. They kept their promise to {{Zucca}}, and were pulling the tent apart and packing away their gear. They did not address their host, not out of fear, but because of the Terin's apparent sadness. {{Zucca}} walked to a field of herbs, and picked out a handful of fresh meppermint, then went over to the mossling-infested fields and distributed some around. A sprig of it lay atop a plumpkin that had long been plagued by these pesky insects. {{Zucca}} waited for a moment - nothing changed.  With a sigh, the Terin walked off but then noticed a mossling flying past, and then another. All had curled antennae. Laris was right, the pests began to fly off in droves. {{Zucca}} laughed, a sound most curious coming from such a grouch, "False-mosslings! How elegant."
  & Eka saw the insects flying away, looking for another place to nest, and smiled, "you did it! Mosslings are leaving!" Saying it loud enough so {{Zucca}} would hear.
  & "False-mosslings," {{Zucca}} corrected, "I thought the world had nothing more to teach me. Not everyone is equipped with the knowledge to save themselves, I mistook this for lethargy. I let some wicked few corrupt my view of others." With those last words, the dirt-encrusted hands covered the Terin's eyes. Terins were supposed to care for others, not just in the sprouting phase, but throughout their lives as well. People never really stopped growing. "I've made a huge mistake."
  & Eka held a hand out. "Not yet you haven't."
  & {{Zucca}} and Eka climbed onto Hush, ready to go intercept the travellers aboard their wagon. Before leaving, the Terin looked at Waldek, "you're in charge, you are the wisest one here. And as for you Lupin-" the Terin smiled at the Verido - a first. "Don't. Touch. Anything."
  & Lupin laughed, and did as told.
  & Hush and its passengers disappeared into the distance, and later returned, leading the wagon back into the oasis. {{Zucca}} did not voice out an apology, but did fill their bellies with fresh foods. It transformed their faces completely. The 3 looked different somehow, less translucent, they were fading away but now they had regained solid shape again. The Terin decided to teach the travellers to grow food, in exchange for help around the fields. They would be fed and housed for a year's time. It was difficult for this grouch to commit to longer than this, the Terin did not trust others completely just yet; but one year seemed perfectly reasonable and after that time perhaps they'd be granted an extension, or better yet, a permanent residence. The travellers accepted. Laris, most of all; they had no ties to any city.
  > <hr/>
  & The next day, Eka and Lupin spent time filling sacks with fresh produce, {{Zucca}} insisted on it. They stood under a mapple tree, picking the fruits by hand. {{Zucca}} had a perch, and let them use it. It's then that the Terin decided to pose the last question: "You're also a carer aren't you? Do you think that making green places and growing sproutlings really matters? On a grand scale I mean, say, you were flying over the planet - or if your head reached above the clouds."
  & Eka had a mouth full of mapple and couldn't answer right away; but just then, {{Zucca}} decided that this is something that would be better left unasked. Instead the farmer asked this: "What is your favorite food?" Hopefully that wouldn't count as two questions.
  & Eka swallowed the bits of mapple, smiling, "I like {{norange}}s a lot, bit rare though."
  & The Terin disappeared inside the house, and returned with a small pouch of fabric, inside, was a seed. "Plant this seed in a green place, in a few year's time you'll get some {{norange}}s." {{Zucca}} explained that this seed had been salvaged from the Iridi raid at the {{Suvalba Sanctuary}}, with it, their host parted with two fresh {{norange}}s for the trip to {{Montore}}. 
  & Lupin thought about the mossling-infected karrot then, and of the treasure of the oasis. Perhaps Eka had known there was something important here, and communicated it via a most terrible joke involving a rotten vegetable. The nursery, while important, was the secret; but a being who can create life in the desert, now that, is a treasure.
  & "It will be planted in the greenest of places, I promise," Eka said, before eyeing Waldek the {{leafhound}} who sat there, at their feet, tail waggling. "Keep your master safe okay?"
  & Waldek barked, before turning to Lupin, its antennae prodding Lupin's legs and chest. It let out a whine then, but {{Zucca}} stepped in. "Don't you have work to do?" The hound barked again, and moved off into the fields with the others. Then, the Terin handed a bag of {{medililly}} herbs to Lupin. "Brew a leaf with your tea, a leaf a day-" {{Zucca}} paused then, a thick hand coming to rest on the Verido's shoulder, "make it part of your routine. A leaf a day - easy to remember." 
  & Lupin accepted the gift, knowing how precious it was; Eka had said that {{medililly}} was hard to grow.
  & The two left shortly after the afternoon of vegetable and fruit picking, their bags were plump with fresh supplies. They wished Laris and the travellers farewell, and thanked the landlord. {{Zucca}} watched as the two, led by Hush, disappeared behind the row of canopied trees.

Montore

  & "I really couldn't let you in, not without identification." A young {{Aodal}} said, standing behind a desk equipped with bars, as if to protect the desk clerk from physical harm. This should have given Lupin some hint as to what sort of town {{Montore}} was, a place with rules and procedures, something that can drive even the calmest of persons up a wall. 
  & "We don't have that in {{Volare}}!" Lupin said, getting hot in the face.
  & "I see." The clerk reached for a pamphlet and handed it over to Lupin through an opening in the bars. The pamphlet read: "So you don't exist."
  & "What is this?"
  & "If you want to exist in the eyes of {{Montore}} you need a piece of identification."
  & "A piece of identification that tells others who I am? That's stupid."
  & "It's the law." The clerk reached under the desk and pulled up a {{durdle}}, a creature with long ears and a spiked shell, it had a tag stuck to one of its spikes with the writing 'd-126'. "See. Even d-126 here has an ID."
  & "Okay. Fine. Say I want to get an ID, where do I get it?"
  & "You'll need to visit the next stall Specter. NEXT!" The clerk called, eager to move on to another customer. 
  & Lupin stormed off, looking for that next stall the clerk had mentioned. It was easy to find, it being the one with a long line of people standing in front of it. A long, long line, snaking around {{Montore}}'s outer wall and through an amassments of tents. Lupin approached a young {{Terin}} who stood in line with a question, "hey, how long you been waiting here?"
  & The Terin appeared to be in a daze. "Forever... maybe. Who cares." The Terin's voice was sluggish.
  & "Yuna's been in line for 5 days" said a voice behind Lupin, it came from another Terin who also stood in line.
  & "That long? For an ID?"
  & "Yep, it's a good job! Pays well."
  & "I don't understand."
  & "Someone's paying me to do wait in line for them, staying in one of those tents out there. When I reach the desk we switch places and I get paid! It's great! There's always people willing to pay not to wait."
  & Lupin estimated that it would take at least 1 week to reach the front desk, "hell of a life..."
  & "Only way I can afford {{Kavava}} root. I just ran out actually, the next couple of days are going to suuuuck."
  & "Is that what that other Terin is on?"
  & "Yuna? Yea. Every surrogate in this line is here for Kavava."  
  & Lupin turned to Yuna again, the Terin appeared to be in another world, body swaying slowly from side to side, "That's not a life. I had a friend in my village who slept most of the time and this is really no different."
  & "Everyone who hasn't tried kavava says that, you don't know what you're talking about."
  & Lupin frowned then and was about to leave but then asked another question. "I was wondering, do you know a {{Zucca}}?"
  & "If I know a {{Zucca}}?"
  & "A Terin, like you. Friend to me."
  & "OH I see how it is, we all know each other is that it?"
  & "Is that a no?" 
  & "You really need to chill, I think you'd be happier on Kavava, has a way of making everything okay," the Terin laughed at this, then seeing the look on the stranger's face decided to say the truth. "Every Terin knows about {{Zucca}}. Has something of great value I hear, many go out into the desert everyday to look for that fabled patch of green, but it's dangerous, most never make it — I bet you know that though, being friend to {{Zucca}}! If you know the location and tell the guards I bet you could get an ID real fast."
  & Lupin wouldn't dream of betraying {{Zucca}}, especially not to anyone from {{Montore}}, not with a field-full of younglings.
  & "There's a guard right there, see? HEY! Hey YOU! Guard person!"
  & Lupin wanted to run away, but the Terin gripped the Verido's collar and kept Lupin in place, perhaps then the Terin realized that it was possible to profit from this, that this information was worthy of some form of compensation and that it was possible to get it through this Verido. The guard, an {{Aodal}}, moved towards them, a tall creature, dressed in the greens of {{Montore}}. {{Aodal}}s are the tallest of desert habitants, second only to {{Uno}}, Lupin thought then. They are strong, brown-skinned with thin eyes and pointed ears. This guard bared these features too, with dark hair combed neatly, to better fit under a green {{Montore}} cap.
  & "I wish you wouldn't call me guard person," the guard said, offended by this. "I've got a name you know, I'm not just some faceless duplicate!" Lupin spied the name on the piece of ID, hanging from the guard's chest, it read '{{Averet}}'.
  & {{Kuzi}} smirked, turning to Lupin, "{{Averet}} here has a fear of being perceived as ordinary."
  & "I've got grand ideas, there are plenty of things I want to do with my life! This is not my forever job you know, I am most definitely NOT going to spend my life on this dust planet making sure kakava addicts like you don't fall down a ditch." {{Averet}} said, red in the face.
  & "The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek," Lupin said.
  & Both {{Averet}} and {{Kuzi}} turned to the Verido then, as if they'd forgotten why they were all here.
  & "Why is this one speaking in riddles," {{Averet}} asked. 
  & "That quote is from Gofsef, a famous Balandrian writer!" Lupin corrected. 
  & "This one knows the whereabouts of {{Zucca}}!" {{Kuzi}} then said, tugging at {{Averet}}'s sleeve.
  & Lupin tried to deny it all, "I'm just a traveling potter, i make pots! I don't know anything about anything! Well, I know about pots! But that's really IT!"
  & {{Kuzi}} knocked on the side of Lupin's head with a fist, "this Verido is hiding something! Not a cave, but an oasis of green and boundless treasures. Isn't that right?" Whenever Lupin tried to tear away, the Terin found some other limb or piece of clothes to grab onto, then, suddenly a {{norange}} fell out of one pocket and rolled onto the ground.
  & Both the guard and {{Kuzi}} froze at the right of it. "A {{norange}}-" the Terin said, releasing Lupin and going to grab the colorful piece of fruit instead. {{Kuzi}} held onto it, stroking the bumps on its surface gently, like stroking the head of a newgrown sprout. There was a hint of sadness in {{Kuzi}}'s eyes, the Terin put a nose to the fruit, smelling it and whispering into it. {{Averet}} then reached forward and tore it away, inspecting it from all angles. "A potter huh? Where did you get this?" A question aimed at Lupin, no doubt, although the guard's eyes were fixed on that fruit.
  & {{Kuzi}} went mad then, and leapt at the {{Averet}} to get it back; after getting a hold of it the Terin ran away, grabbing Lupin's arm and darting into the crowd. The guard rushed after them, but soon lost sight of the two runaways...
  & {{Kuzi}} stopped once they had gone far away enough, breathing hard, the {{norange}} in hand. 
  & "You lost your place in line," Lupin said, shocked. "Weeks of waiting-!"
  & "Doesn't matter," {{Kuzi}} replied, eyes on the fruit still. "You really were at that oasis."
  & Lupin hesitated at first, but nodded. "Yea, you thought I was kidding? This was a parting gift."
  & "{{norange}}s are extinct. You know that right? Thought the plant and seed had gone up in flames with the citadel and the rest. I love the smell of {{norange}}s, warmed by the sun- some have tried to synthesize the smell and taste, but it's not the same. I forgot how fragrant it was, sweet, yet bitter."
  & "You can have it," Lupin then said with a smile. "It's yours to eat."
  & "I love the smell, but I also kind of hate it, brings back certain memories I would have preferred to forget-" {{Kuzi}} then said, the {{norange}} resting against the Terin's cheek, fingers lightly bruising the surface, "if you know what i mean."
  & Lupin knew why. After the Iridi raids and changes in the world the Terins had grown lethargic, abandoning their ways, they stopped growing food and lost their connection with the soil. 
  & "When I'm on kavava, the dichotomy, the dualism, just disappears. There's no opposite. Love is hate, and hate is love. This {{norange}} is a {{norange}} and I don't attribute anything else to it, it is neither delicious or disgusting." While talking, {{Kuzi}}'s eyes were set on that fruit, as if having a silent conversation with it. Then the Terin smiled, breaking out of that trance, throwing the fruit up in the air and then catching it again in mid-flight. "Why do you want to get into {{Montore}} anyway?"
  & "{{bam}} cake and tea."
  & {{Kuzi}} laughed. "As good a reason as any. I'll get you an ID, I've got some connections."
  > <hr/>
  & The next day, Lupin and Eka went to wait at the foot of the eastern wall, encircling the city. {{Kuzi}} had instructed Lupin to wait here, but now, was past their meeting time and their helper was a no-show. They wandered back over to the town entrance, making sure to avoid any guards, while keeping an eye open for {{Kuzi}}. By then, word about their presence and their possession of real {{norange}}s had reached the ears of many other Terins. Many of the ones standing in line for ID glanced at them as they walked past, "Hey!" One of them called out. "Is it true that you've met {{Zucca}}?"
  & Lupin shushed the Terin. "Yes, yes — but keep your voice low."
  & "Got any more of those {{norange}}s?"
  & Eka did have one left, but wasn't sure if it was a good idea to say so, these Terins looked very eager.
  & "I'll get you an ID for one!" One Terin said. "I've got coin, you want coin for it?"
  & "Uh oh—" Eka said, noticing the amount of attention they were getting, some guards turned, tipped off by the many Terins beginning to encircle them and shouting offers to them. 
  & Then the Woth moved out of its glass ball, and reached into Eka's pack, pulling out the last {{norange}}. The woth then took off with it, high and above everyone's head. Eka shouted another UH OH, "Hum hum come back!" The Terins all stared at the brightly coloured fruit, jumping into the air to try and grab a hold of it, the guards saw it plainly now, and hurried over, but then they too began to try and take it. The woth just hovered outside of their reach, and then took off and flew inside of the city, flying over the main entrance. Many followed, rushing inside, the guards at the entrance too had left their post in an attempt to get their hands on it "{{norange}}!" "GET IT GET IT!" It was complete havoc, a horde was following the woth inside the city, even the desk clerk was there! Eka and Lupin were able to get inside, "That woth is brilliant!" Lupin said, "An first-class instigator of change! A genius!!" They'd made their way into the city, without {{Kuzi}}'s help and without ID. 
  & "CAKE AND TEA!" Lupin shouted, running inside.
  & Eka laughed. "You're going to start a riot!"
  & "I'm just a follower, the woth is the mastermind!"
  & The woth landed on top of a high building, setting the {{norange}} on a visible  and inaccessible place, and it's there that it waited as the people on the ground gathered round to look at the thought-be-extinct fruit. 
  & Eka and Lupin ran deeper into the city, past buildings and street vendors, until they arrived at the main plaza. The plaza was a flat clear space, encircled with tiny stalls with vendors selling a variety of flavored food stamps.
  & "Get your bobonion soup patch here! Best in the city!"
  & "In the mood for some mapples? Get the patch right here, right now!"
  & The floor of the city was dusty, with some debris here and there; some younger workers were there to catch every stray item, usually the left-over patches which inevitably found their way to the ground after use. The people of {{Montore}} threw them over their shoulders when they were done, mirroring the habit of throwing away remains of fresh fruits and vegetables. For such foods, throwing it on the ground was okay since it would come apart and disappear, the same couldn't be said of these stamps. 
  & "Where do the used stamps go?" Eka asked one of the younglings, who pointed to a building near the northern end of town, adjoined to the outerwall. "And what happens when it's full?"
  & The youngling cocked a head to one side, "I guess they'll put it in another building." Then another worker piped up, "maybe we can bury it!"
  & "There's no plan?" Eka asked, "why not eat real food instead? Real food doesn't have packaging."
  & The young workers made faces when hearing this, "Real food? But it comes out of the ground!" "It's so dirty!" Another said. 
  & "You come out of the ground too y'know," Eka pointed out.
  & The young ones didn't know what to say to that, they looked themselves over, as if to make sure they didn't have dirt on them still.
  & Every house, or business in this city was square, with thick walls made from a mixture of clay, sand, waterstones and dried grasses. They were constructed in a way that they kept the inhabitants cool in the day, and warm at night. A large building sat at one end of the grand plaza, also a square, but with smaller ones ajdjoined to it. A symbol was engraved into the front, the {{Montore}} insignia, also present on the face of every coin. This building, was likely the residence of someone important.
  & A large structure sat in the middle of the plaza, a thick beam with a large wheel around it, spinning slowly. Eka then noticed that the beam and wheel were connected to a much larger cog, built under the plaza. Following one of these long branches Eka arrived into a bakery, inside another of these large beams came out of a hole in the floor, and it, had a series of smaller branches and cogs attached to it leading all the way to a flour mill. 
  & "Whoa-" Eka said, grinning widely. "This is brilliant!" The city was build on top of a huge cog, used to power devices in the businesses of the city. 
  & In the bakery, the 'beam' had a movable arm that could be repositioned to another location to power different items like the mill, the flour mixer and the dough beater. 
  & "You shouldn't mill so much muckwheat!" An old {{Aodal}} said to another, likely the owner of the bakery, "we sell so little now, no one wants any! Why waste it?"
  & The bakery owner sighed at these words, and glanced over at fresh loaf of muckwheat bread, "people in this town need to be reminded of what real food looks like, and smells like!"
  & "They're going to shut us down Avril. We need coin to keep this place in operation."
  & Eka overheard this conversation, and was rather sad to hear it. This was a direct result of the increasing production of food stamps. Eka carried these words back to Lupin, who had somehow gotten dragged into a {{Montore}} tour group. Leaving it was hard, everyone kept pushing them from one place to another, like a shepard herding sheplings. 
  & "The town operates on a schedule!" A tour guide to the city said to a group of newly-arrived visitors. "3 times a day, during rush hour, the strongest in the city come to the main beam in the plaza and give the master cog a big boost by spinning it faster manually! Food stamp production increases dramatically during these times, to meet the increase in demand. Outside of rush hour, the cog spins at a continuous and consistent speed, made possible by the outer cog that is built on top of the city wall. The outer cog is equipped with sails, using the power of the wind to keep moving all day everyday! But remember, currently Beobug is trying to build a new systemt that would remove the need for the cog system entirely! Imagine!"
  & Lupin and Eka began to tour the city like this, following the guide, they found their way into a factory that makes sweet-tasting food patches. On arrival every one was given a sample, the guide gave Eka a '{{bam}} cake' patch. "It's just like having the real thing! Try it!"
  & Eka smelled the patch, but did not dare to apply it to the skin, remembering what {{Zucca}} had said about them not being a substitute for real food. 
  & "Our grand leader {{Monty}} had the idea for this wonderful product! It has saved countless lives, and propelled this city to fame!"
  & "{{Monty}}?" Lupin said, loud enough for others to hear.
  & The entire group turned to look at the Verido, "you mean to say you don't know the grand leader's name?" One of the tourists asked, clearly upset by this.
  & "Oh — well I was kidding, of course I know!"
  & "Smooth." Eka whispered.
  & "Yea? Then when's {{Monty}} day hmm?!"
  & All eyes were on Lupin then, waiting for an answer to this supposedly obvious question. 
  & "Um. Today?" Lupin said, tentatively, tipped off by the decorations in both the town and the factory.
  & The group then relaxed, all smiles. "That's right! Today is {{Monty}} day, celebrating the green day of our grand leader!"
  & Lupin was eager to get away from this group of zealots. As soon as the tour group made their way to the gift shop the Verido and Eka snuck out.
  & "I'd like to give this {{Monty}} a piece of my mind," Lupin said, not impressed with the factory. 
  & Just when Lupin said this a horn sounded out, the plaza was filled with people, gathered around a small platform that had been erected over the central beam of the cog, causing it to spin. A short creature climbed up a ladder built into the side of the beam, and went to stand on the platform, because it turned, this enabled the speaker to address everyone from whatever direction at the same time. This, Dot had said, makes everyone feel important.
  & "{{Monty}}! {{Monty}}!" Everyone shouted, and this got Lupin's attention. The character standing on the little platform was a {{Finiku}}, bald, and wearing a striped jacket and pants. "{{Monty}} loves you all, and thanks you for your hard work! {{Montore}} couldn't be as great as it is without your help!"
  & The crowd cheered at these words, this {{Finiku}} wasn't {{Monty}}, but a representative that everyone around was referring to as 'Dot'. "Production of food stamps is at an all-time high!" The crowd cheered again, as Dot began to list their yearly accomplishments aloud; from the amount of methane produced and processed by the beobug {{sandfin}}s, to the gradual adoption and acceptance of coin as a token of exchange outside of {{Montore}}.
  & Lupin pulled out one of those 'coins' out from a side pocket, Eka spotted the coin then. "How did you get this?"
  & "Gree gave it to me, don't know what to do with it though. I can't say I like the idea of it. My spirit doesn't feel elevated at all."
  & Eka smirked, grabbed the coin from Lupin's hand and then disappeared into the crowd. "Eka? EKA! What are you - ah, never mind. I'll just wait here- alone." Moments after Eka left, Lupin's eyes found a familiar face in the crowd, {{Kuzi}}. The Terin was sitting on a crate. Lupin rushed over. "{{Kuzi}}! Hey you forgot to meet us to—", the Verido stopped talking, noticing that like the other Terin's in the line outside of town yesterday, {{Kuzi}} too, was high on kavava.
  & "Oh hey Loopy!" {{Kuzi}} said, smirking.
  & "You didn't—" Lupin said, knowing full well that {{Kuzi}} had no coin to purchase kavava.
  & {{Kuzi}} looked at the Verido with red eyes, the faint scent of the plant in the air around them. The Terin had been happy, comfortably cocooned into a kavava bubble; but now, seeing Lupin there, disappointed, caused the bubble to burst. Hands came to cover {{Kuzi}}'s face. "I didn't even taste it. I'm so weak."
  & Lupin went to sit down on that same crate, shoulder to shoulder with {{Kuzi}}. Both said nothing, sitting together with Dot's voice in the background. Just then the woth returned, carrying a bit of {{norange}} peel around, what it was able to salvage from the rooftop. Lupin grabbed the peel, and handed it over to {{Kuzi}}. "You can taste it now."
  & The Terin pushed it away. "No, I don't like how it makes me feel. I'd rather forget."
  & A curious onlooker noticed the {{norange}} peel. "THE {{NORANGE}}!" Word of the {{norange}} on the rooftop had traveled, everyone in town knew of it. Dot stopped speaking then, words falling on deaf ears as a crowd gathered around Lupin, as if drawn to the word itself. There was no way to run this time, guards arrived, one of them recognizing both Lupin and the Terin from before. "You two...!"
  & The guard gripped Lupin's arm, then began to search for the piece of ID. "What? No ID either?! We've got a Specter here!" The guard didn't even bother to check {{Kuzi}} for one.
  & "HEY I've got ID! I exist! See? SEE?" {{Kuzi}} yelled, fumbling around for it, but the guard didn't want to hear it and both were dragged away from the crowds, across the plaza and into the square building with the {{Montore}} insignia. They were brought into the inner courtyard, and were asked to stay there.
  & {{Kuzi}} gave Lupin a shove. "Why'd you have to get me involved?!"
  & "I didn't do anything! Everyone here just gets real crazy whenever there's mention of {{norange}}s! How was I to know?!"
  & "You can't just go flaunting that stuff around!"
  & "I was NOT flaunting."
  & {{Kuzi}} realized something then. "That's how you got into the city."
  & Lupin smirked. "Another accident."
  & "They're going to put us into a mill and grind us into food stamps! That's what's gonna happen!" {{Kuzi}} yelled.
  & "Its you fault, you were supposed to meet us but instead you went on a kavava bender!"
  & {{Kuzi}} began to fight Lupin in the courtyard, although the fight occurred mostly on one side and less so on the other. The Verido didn't know how to fight, and made a dance of it, avoiding the onslaught of fists with ease given the fact that {{Kuzi}} was still high on root juices. Their fight was interrupted by the guard's return. "HEY stop that!" The {{Aodal}} instructed them to follow, and brought them in front of a large door, made of carved {{banabo}}.
  & "Who does this belong to?" The guard then asked the two, holding a piece of {{norange}} peel.
  & Lupin didn't want to put a claim to it, having no desire to get ground up into anything. {{Kuzi}} addressed the guard then. "How would I have a {{norange}}, I was born here and never left, same as you."
  & The guard gripped Lupin's arm then. "Right. Come with me Specter."
  & "I bet the food stamp version of you will be DISGUSTING!" {{Kuzi}} shouted, just as another guard arrived to escort the Terin outside.
  & Lupin gulped as the large {{banabo}} door opened, revealing a thick blind, obscuring both the room and its occupant. "Go," the guard said, pushing the captive onward. Lupin took a few stepsd forward, stopping a the draping, then hands found an opening in the fabric and the Verido pushed on. A young Terin, dressed in a green robe was on the other side. "You're the specter, the {{norange}} smuggler?"
  & "Specter I get, but smuggler? That's escalating things a bit don't you think?"
  & "Follow me," the young Terin said then, pushing past yet another set of drapings, dividing the entrance to the rest of the room. After traversing the last set of fabric blinders, Lupin stepped into a cluttered, and messy room, filled with objects, most notably, it had plants! There was a gap in the ceiling, with a roof to shield it from the sun, but high enough to bring some light into the room. 
  & "The {{norange}} thief is here."
  & "Now wait a minute—" Lupin began.
  & Another Terin pushed out from under a pile of documents, an older one with greying hair and a thin young face. This was {{Monty}}. {{Monty}} wore a simple pair of pants, not bothering to wear a shirt or shoes at all. This Terin did not bear the look of a grand leader.
  & "Where did you get it?" {{Monty}} asked, nonchalantly, while checking over the leaves of a nearby plant.
  & "I think that if I did say, I'd betray a friend and put many other lives in danger."
  & {{Monty}}'s ears perked at this. "Um, you're talking about {{Zucca}}."
  & Lupin nodded.
  & "Didn't think that grouch was alive, has had many green days, too many some would say. I'm happy {{Zucca}} was able to save some {{norange}} seeds," {{Monty}} said, switching attention to another plant, "norcorn patties just aren't the same without {{norange}} sauce."
  & "Hope you don't me saying but... are you really {{Monty}}? The leader of this city?"
  & {{Monty}}'s yellow eyes moved to Lupin then. "Not what you were expecting?"
  & "No, not at all... you've got all these plants, feeding people food patches, the Beobug goons and their {{sandfin}}s that spit out smoke- it's horrific! Hard to believe it comes from you."
  & "You have a problem with innovation?" {{Monty}} asked.
  & "I've got a problem with pain, and misery." Lupin replied.
  & "The food patches helped feed the refugees during the Iridi raids."
  & "Did you know that Beobug employees sell expired food patches to the hungry for coin?"
  & {{Monty}} thought about this for a moment. "And you're holding me responsible."
  & "Yes, yes I am."
  & "The misuse of my creations is really not my fault, I couldn't have imagined them using it for personal gain."
  & "People in this city aren't eating real food anymore! Everyone is obssessed with coin, a useless piece of metal! It's ridiculous!"
  & "Coin was supposed to be a way to simplify exchanges in the city, Dot had other plans for it. It was really a good idea, but again... others have pushed the concept a bit too far. It's no one's fault, everyone is doing their best. Everyone is just trying to survive out here. To be honest, I just decided to stop having ideas."
  & Lupin noted the amount of drawings and books scattered about, clearly {{Monty}} wasn't done having ideas. "You mean you decided to stop telling others about them."
  & "Yes, I suppose you're right. The giant cog was a good idea — it was my first, my best. Should have stopped there. It doesn't matter anyway, I heard Dot was planning on removing the entire system to replace it with one  powered by natural gas instead of wind... light and power in every home is the goal, the people of {{Montore}} have expressed interest in this already. People are willing to pay for energy. Beobug created this need for it — it's clever, really."
  & "D'you ever tell anyone all this? That's it a bad idea? Maybe if they heard it from you they'd stop?"
  & {{Monty}} didnt seem to agree with this theory. "People have forgotten who I am, what I look like; for instance, if I were to go out there on the plaza right now, shouting my name for all to hear, they wouldn't believe I was {{Monty}}. Especially, as you suggest, if I were out there speaking against my own ideas. Heh- they'd lock me up, thinking I was there to tarnish the reputation of the great leader."
  & Lupin took note of a painting on the backwall, it much resembled the portrait carved on the coin and it was true that it did not look like this version of {{Monty}}.
  & "My artist got carried away with the representation, thought I needed to look more imposing, more angular — it's why I'm here really, and that no one can see me. If they did, they'd throw me out... thinking I was a pretender. Staying here, at least I'm safe and free to think up ideas all day, everyday."
  & "Yea. You're comfortable while people suffer."
  & "People are suffering all the time {{norange}} thief. I was wondering, how did you get {{Zucca}} to give you that fruit?"
  & Lupin bore a sad expression, eyes moving to the entrance. "If you want to know the full story you'll have to walk out of here with me. How about it? Making {{Monty}} day synonymous with the day of the grand reveal?"
  & {{Monty}} smirked, "I would have really enjoyed hearing that story... for you to know, and me to wonder I suppose." Saying this, the grand leader continued to look after the plants in the room, checking the leaves for signs of malnutrition with much love and care, like a {{leafhound}} would.
  & "Why did you ask me here?"
  & "A Verido with a {{norange}}, a {{hyroo}} and a round-eared companion is a curious thing - wouldn't you have asked yourself in here?"
  & "I'll add that story to the pile, in exchange for you to tell the truth. It's a good one-" Lupin teased. 
  & {{Monty}} seemed amused by this, but not amused enough. "Goodbye Specter."
  & Lupin let out a deep sigh, there was nothing to do then but leave. The Verido glanced at the second hand. "What now? What happens to the ones who don't exist in the eyes of {{Montore}}? Do i get ground up into fodder?"
  & The green-clad Terin laughed, "that story I made up has really gotten around! Ah well, if it helps keep people in line." With this, Lupin was escorted out of the building. "You need to leave the city, right this instant." {{Monty}}'s second hand watched as Lupin stepped into the main plaza with a guard, making their way towards the main gate. The guard kept close, to make sure the wrongdoer didn't decide to take a detour on the way out. {{Kuzi}} did see the Verido, but said nothing. There was nothing to say.
  & Eka stood by {{Kuzi}}, chewing loudly, eating chunks of freshly baked {{bam}} cake. "D'you know where I can get some meppermint tea around here?"
  & {{Kuzi}} looked over, catching scent of the bread. "No, I don't know."
  & "You want some?" Eka offered, putting a slice of bread under the Terin's nose. "I could eat it all myself, but that would make me a glutton. You eating a bit would make me feel like less of one. At least I'll be a generous glutton you know? That sounds better somehow."
  & {{Kuzi}} was hungry, having forgotten to buy some food patches. "Sure, more for you than me though." {{Kuzi}} chewed on the piece of bread, the taste of it was like an explosion of flavor! The effect was so strong that the Terin's body began to shiver uncontrollably. "There's gingin in it... I love gingin! Well -I used to."
  & "Enjoy it, this is likely the last bread the bakery will ever bake. It's closing tomorrow, not enough people buying bread... shame. They make amazing pastries too — Avril and Ira i mean, they're the real deal! Soon they'll be gone. Extinct, like the {{norange}}s."
  & {{Kuzi}} stopped chewing, saddened by this conversation; this was usually the point where the Terin would start ingesting some mind-numbing kavava. 
  & "Oh! Now i remember-" Eka began, "Avril's grandmapa Moki was the one making the mepperpint tea! Had a garden outside, it was a popular place back in the day. Some Terin was working there too — name was Azul i think, was the only one who really understood mepperpint. I miss it, but you know, if you drink too much of it-'
  & "—It makes your eyes sprout leaves," {{Kuzi}} finished, smiling faintly. 
  & Eka nodded. "Exactly! Alright. Well, have some more bread. I'm going to go for a walk now."
  & {{Kuzi}} stood there, a giant slice of {{bam}} bread in hand, and eyes moving over to that bakery; for some reason, {{Kuzi}} had forgotten it existed, lost in a perpetual kavava daze. Now, it's like the fog had cleared, and the world had much more detail in it; the smells were stronger and the the sound of the world was like music. Without a moment's hesitation, and drawn by the smell of muckwheat, the Terin walked to the bakery and went inside.
  & Lupin was outside of the city, sitting in their tent and waiting for Eka's return. Hush was there, conversing with the woth, listening to a re-telling of today's events. 
  > <hr/>
  & Eka arrived before nightfall, finding Lupin in the tent still; but there was something different, something unusual...
  & "You've got a cup on your head, you know that right?" Eka asked, smiling.
  & "It's a thinking cup," Lupin said, with a sigh, knowing all-to-well how ridiculous it was. 
  & "Wow! Is it working? Are you having some great thoughts right now?"
  & Lupin removed the cup then, staring into it. "No — Maybe it's because there's no tea in it."
  & Eka presented a slice of {{bam}} bread to the downtrodden Verido. "Did not find meppermint tea, but this bread stands well enough on its own. Try it."
  & "Mission failed," Lupin said.
  & "How so?"
  & "On getting some {{Montore}} {{bam}} cake and mepperpint tea."
  & "No, I think our excursion into {{Montore}} was a success! We learned many things today, made friends too!"
  & "Friends? Everyone here thinks I'm a fiend. Did you not see my walk of shame?"
  & "You've learned more of the world Lupin, and with this you are wiser."
  & "I was hoping we could help somebody..."
  & Eka went to hug Lupin then, "is that what you think we're doing? Helping others?"
  & "Yes? Maybe? I don't know."
  & "We came here for cake and tea Lew."
  & "Yea. Yea you're right," saying this, Lupin took a bit of the {{bam}} cake, "Ooooh wow — this is so good!" The woth moved out of its glass house then, eager to get a bite of this famed pastry, even Hush was intrigued. "I'm not sharing, sorry!" Lupin said, but both creatures leapt towards the Verido then, eager to get some of the remaining chunk of bread. Lupin was pinned to the floor, with Hush chewing on the bread and the woth eating stray crumbs off its snout. "This is like the {{norange}}s episode all over again!"
  & The next day, the gang packed up their tent and gear and left the city of {{Montore}}. Their experience there wasn't ideal, but as Eka had said, they had learned a thing, and learning a thing a day is what's most important. 
  > <hr/>
  & Unbeknownst to them, a small revolution was going on in the city; {{Kuzi}} had sold the last of the kavava in exchange for coin to pay for more bread at the bakery. This sell, helped to convince Ira to keep the bakery open, at least for another day or two. 
  & The Terin went to say hello to {{Averet}} that day, they'd grown up together, and while their lives had taken different turns they were still friendly to each other — most times. 
  & "Hey {{Kuzi}}, keeping out of trouble today I hope," {{Averet}} said.
  & "Yea. Keeping the peace, in my own way."
  & There was a pause between them then, but the {{Aodal}} spoke again, "d'you know where I can get some norcorn patties around here?"
  & "I'd ask Avril's bakery."
  & "Bakery?"
  & {{Kuzi}} pointed to it. "Yea, it's where I got this bread. You want to try some?"
  & {{Averet}} grabbed a slice of bread and started to eat it, "oh — OH! This is good...! It's so moist! Why do I never buy real bread anyway?" The bread disappeared, consummed within seconds. "Thanks for that {{Kuzi}}, I'll drop by to see Avril later to ask about the norcorn — you see, I've got this piece of {{norange}}..."
