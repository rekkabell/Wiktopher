<img src="../media/content/fauna.ilk.jpg" />
<p>
  In a room, in a house, on the back of a giant, lives a Verido, a teenager whose name is a mixture of two good things: Lu, for the sky, and Pin, a type of winged beetle. "Sky beetle, yep. That's my name" Lupin said, busy upturning the
  place. While proud of this name, Lupin did not choose it. Verido are unique in the way that their names appear on their skin a few years after they're grown. They take on the appearance of lines, and swirls, and when interpreted by a
  skilled Reader, they're translated into the common tongue. "Now where is that scarf..."
</p>
<p>
  Lupin could never remember where things were, much-needed items had a way of getting 'lost'. Worse yet, was that Lupin also liked to borrow things. All <a href="lexicon.html#verido">Verido</a> borrowed from one another. If they saw
  something they liked in the house of another, they would take it without asking. Objects had a way of making the rounds and somehow always ended up back where they'd started — that is, unless Lupin was the borrower. Many objects from
  homes around the village never returned. Everyone knew who to blame, yet no one came to claim anything back, having found joy in owning fewer things.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin lived in a tall narrow house. Because the ground in Volare was never still, the buildings were designed to twist and sway without breaking. Lupin liked sleeping from a hammock it would never stop swinging, carried by the constant
  motion of the world. Overlooking the hammock was a gap in the ceiling, a window equipped with a heavy storm shutter. With a clearing like this, Lupin could sleep with the stars. Those lights, unlike all earthly objects, were impossible to
  borrow. The young Verido liked to pretend though, with fingers obscuring the edges and narrowing down into a pinch.
</p>
<p>
  The kitchen was on the bottom floor, a cramped — "Cosy! It's cosy is what it is," Lupin said. Yes. A cosy area with a pantry, a fire bowl and a cold pot. The fire bowl, like many other objects in the house, was made out of molded carapace shavings. The bowl had ashes from yesterday's cooking. The cold pot had another pot inside it, with its outer wall completely covered in sand. In the innermost pot lay fresh <a href="lexicon.html#teaweet">teaweet</a> berries. Then, there was the pantry, consisting of two long poles stuck out of the ground with braided <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a> baskets hanging inbetween. Lupin kept a variety of herbs and root vegetables in these, like <a href="lexicon.html#loomaroot">looma root</a>s, <a href="lexicon.html#bibiskiss">bibiskiss</a> and <a href="lexicon.html#plumpkins">plumpkins</a>. On the ground lay a box with a sack of {{teaweet}} berries, and next to it was a jar with a bubbly brown mixture labelled as "Henbi". Lupin stopped baking when <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a> died, but never stopped feeding Henbi the smellydough starter. When alone, the Verido preferred to prepare simple meals, like grilled root vegetables on a bed of brown agarice with a side of tea. 
</p>
<p>
  Some bottles of tea were steeping outside right now, warmed by the sun. Momentarily forgetting about the scarf, Lupin stepped out and put a nose to a bottle of <a href="lexicon.html#lickyroot">licky root</a> tea, judged it to be ready and
  brought it inside. The drink was syrupy and sweet. The dark circular roots of the plant, heavy with liquid, lay at the bottom of the bottle. <a href="lexicon.html#lickyroot">Licky root</a> was grown here in the village, Lupin walked to
  the base of Vol's nape everyday to harvest it. Few plants could thrive up here, the altitude did not permit much, although shroos and small garden herbs were plentiful.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin sighed when seeing the state of the place. The floor of the main room had many objects, pieces of unfinished projects, attempts at honing a skill — any skill. Lupin had tried to learn to knit a hat, but the result was too horrid to
  wear. "Why would you make a hat with so many large holes?" A neighbour had asked. The hat had then become the head of a mop, which to this day never mopped up anything. Lupin had seen <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a> knit many times,
  the motions were familiar but these dumb hands could not replicate them.
</p>
<p>
  All in the village had a skill, but this young Verido feared to possess none — that is, unless the art of cluttering spaces could be artful in some way. Lupin was short, and possessed little body strength, but could beat anyone in a
  dumpling eating contest — again, not an ability that could benefit others. This was the truth behind the compulsive borrowing, born out of Lupin's desire to discover a worthwhile passion.
</p>
<p>"LOOK AT YOU LEW! All dressed up and fancy-like!"</p>
<p>
  Lupin spun right around to look at who was there. It was <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a>, a friend and resident of Volare. <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> was taller and older than Lupin, with hair standing on end,
  higher than anyone in the village. A single strand hung low, weighed down by a single blue bead.
</p>
<p>
  "I am fancy aren't I?" Lupin was wearing traditional ceremonial wear, a set only worn on special occasions like on <a href="lexicon.html#greenday">Green Day</a>s or <a href="lexicon.html#leapingday">Leaping Day</a>s. Lupin had a necklace
  of blue thread cascading down over a bare chest, the lower half of the body was covered with a patterned knee-long cloth, and superimposed with a woven mat. "I spent all of last night looking for each piece. Now if only I could find my
  scarf."
</p>
<p>"Your hair looks nice blue!" <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> said, impressed with Lupin's handiwork. "Your face paint though is um— well, it's um —it's unique is what it is!"</p>
<p>During special events, Verido dyed their hair and faces blue using the crushed pigments of the fruit of the <a href="lexicon.html#looberry">looberry</a> plant. "I ran out of looberries about halfway into it." Lupin admitted.</p>
<p>
  "It's fine. People will just assume you've forgotten to finish, people expect that from you so it's completely in character! Anywaaay! I got this for you! A gift!" The visitor was dressed in plain clothes, holding a basket of
  <a href="lexicon.html#trumpetflower">trumpet flower</a> sprouts, the stems kept fresh by a layer of earth. "Thought we could hang around here and plant these! In a few months they'll start flowering and you know what that means!
  Thoughtful of me don't you think? No one else tends to your need for intoxicants like I do."
</p>
<p>"YOUR need you mean. Don't you know what today is?"</p>
<p>"Sure I do, but we're not going" <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> said.</p>
<p>Lupin laughed. "I'm not gonna sit here with you waiting for these plants to grow."</p>
<p>
  "Why not? I also brought some <a href="lexicon.html#kabacho">kabacho</a> to drink! It's been steeping for a year! It's going to be real strong." <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> held a bottle of red liquid with a wrinkly fruit
  floating inside it.
</p>
<p>"They're expecting me Ros, the whole town is! As much as I'd like to just sit around and drink with you all day I've got to go! I don't have a choice — you know that..."</p>
<p>"You DO have a choice!" <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> corrected. "You think you don't, but you can do whatever you want! Come on, don't you think it'd be more fun to do this instead?"</p>
<p>"Ceremony's more important I think."</p>
<p>"So they say," <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> said. "Why go at all? I mean, you already know you won't be named <a href="lexicon.html#voice">Voice</a> so... why bother?"</p>
<p>"Tradition."</p>
<p>
  "Right. Don't you think it unfair though? To be part of a contest with a predetermined result? <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s family has always been <a href="lexicon.html#voice">Voice</a>, since
  <a href="lexicon.html#volare">Volare</a>'s time and that's not about to change. When you think about it, there's really no point in you being there at all! If I were you I'd stay here. Come on, give me a mug that I can fill."
</p>
<p>
  "It's just like you to say something like that." Lupin said, busy upturning the place, lifting every book. Lupin did find other things thought to be lost, but these stayed in their spot, to be forgotten and rediscovered again at a later
  more convenient time. "I've got to be there. Don't ask me again."
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a>, lacking a mug, took a sip of <a href="lexicon.html#kabacho">kabacho</a> from the bottle instead. "Oh—OH! SO strong! Oh my lips are numb!" <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> struggled for a
  moment, trying to finish a thought, having much trouble getting the lips and tongue to cooperate. "So you're alright with pretending you can win this?"
</p>
<p>

  "I'm not pretending! AH–It doesn't matter! I'm fine with it is what I'm saying." Lupin moved to the other side of the room to peer behind a table. "AH! It's here! I've found it!" The long blue scarf had been hiding there this whole time, wedged between the table and the wall. Lupin put the scarf on, coiling it tight. "I wouldn't make a good <a href="lexicon.html#voice">Voice</a>, I've got no skills... <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> can speak and run backwards? Did you know that? How can I compete with that!"
</p>
<p>
  "Did you ever think that maybe you're always underperforming because you know you can't win? That whatever you do won't change the outcome, so you know, why try?" <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a>'s lips had turned a bright red
  colour then — another effect of the <a href="lexicon.html#kabacho">kabacho</a>.
</p>
<p>"I'll find something else I'm good at. I'll see it more clearly when this thing is over, I know it."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> set the <a href="lexicon.html#kabacho">kabacho</a> on the ground, then found an amusing hat and decided to keep it. Ros then picked up a <a href="lexicon.html#koutra">koutra</a> from the floor and
  tried to play it. "Bit out of tune. Won't be impressing anyone with an out of tune <a href="lexicon.html#koutra">koutra</a>."
</p>
<p>
  "Yea. It did sound terrible." Lupin said with a sigh, eyeing the stringed instrument. "Look. I've got to go." The Verido began to move toward the door, stepping in between objects to get to it, then came up to the bottle of
  <a href="lexicon.html#kabacho">kabacho</a> and decided to take a sip. "For my nerves." Lupin said.
</p>
<p>
  "Hey! What if you actually did become <a href="lexicon.html#voice">Voice</a>?" <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> yelled. "Imagine! We could go drink at <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a> all day! Best view in Volare! No one
  would bother us up there!"
</p>
<p>"Now that would be sacrilegious!" Lupin said with a laugh, before breaking into a run. The town centre was near but the sun was high, any moment now the ceremony would start.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> was standing before the <a href="lexicon.html#volare">Volare</a> town hall, an imposing edifice on the lowermost area of the <a href="lexicon.html#ilk">Ilk</a>'s nape. The town was animated, there were
  people everywhere, busy wrapping ribbons around poles and hanging wreaths on every door. Everyone waved at <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>, smiling and saying things like: <i>"Good luck in there!"</i> or,
  <i>"You were born to do it!"</i> <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> wondered if they said these things to cousin <a href="lexicon.html#lupin">Lupin</a> too.
</p>
<p>
<a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had short, pale sandy hair, heavy with decorative beads; a strong upper torso and legs and was taller than many of the other villagers. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> liked to climb, and did well enough in most sports, many envied the Verido's ability to do well in everything. Today, <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> appeared less confident than usual. The young Verido looked up at the Ilk's head, hands fidgeting with the ceremonial necklace.
</p>
<p>
  "<a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>!" <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> called out, waving a hand to try and get <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s attention. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> was bound to a push-chair. A younger Verido was there to push the centenarian around. "<a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>!" <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> called again.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> was not too old, but retired due to a shroo infection. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> could no longer move unassisted, and as the shroo grew, the more organs began to fail. This was a common affliction. Everyone knew that when the shroo spread to the lungs or the heart, that the affected had little chance to recover.</p>
<p>"Anyone in there?" <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> said. "Answer me space sprout."</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> groaned. "I don't have to say yes yes at every word! You know I'm listening mapa..."</p>
<p>"Well I want to hear you say it."</p>
<p>"I'm nervous okay. You know I am!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but you forget that I went through the same with cousin <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a>, and my mapa went through it too with cousin <a href="lexicon.html#laggra">Laggra</a>. I'm here, right now, telling you that you have
  nothing to worry about! Our family line is strong." <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> smiled up at <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>, admiring the blue face paint that <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had applied so perfectly.
  "It happened ages ago, but looking at you now, it's strange... like being on the wrong side of a mirror."</p>
<p>"Cousin <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a> was really good. I heard the stories."</p>
<p>
  "Yes, that's true. <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a> would have done many more great things, but we can't think about what could have been, we've got to focus on what is! Lupin is good, but lacks your focus. I have to go, but I'll see you in there!" the Verido helper wheeled <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> away, both disappeared into the town hall, passing under a banner with the words "Voice of Volare". 
</p>
<p>A small <a href="lexicon.html#leafling">leafling</a> stood near the banner, trying to sound the words written on it in <a href="lexicon.html#ilken">ilken</a> – with little success.</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound right at all." The <a href="lexicon.html#leafling">leafling</a> whined.</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> joined the leafling under the banner. "You almost got it you know! Watch me." Hands moved into place, cupping the mouth in the right way, then came a collection of whistles.</p>
<p>
  The sounds varied in pitch and rhythm. The sound was otherworldly, whistled at such high volume that if strangers — who knew nothing of the language — heard it, they would think it belonged to a giant.
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> whistled it a second time, to make sure the leafling had heard it right. "See? Voice-of-Volare. You try it! Watch your the pitch on the vowels."
</p>
<p>Eyes wide, the leafling positioned both hands and lips in the same way, and tried again with much success. "Do you really talk to the Ilk?"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> smiled. "No, not yet, but if I'm Voice then yes! We'll talk everyday!"</p>
<p>"WOW!" stars appeared in the young leafling's eyes, at the thought of <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> being able to converse with 'The Great Carrier'.</p>
<p>
  Volare villagers were setting up a small stage near the town hall. They would be playing music here tonight, songs in <a href="lexicon.html#ilken">ilken</a> by way of plucked instruments like the traditional
  <a href="lexicon.html#donmol">donmol</a>, or the humble <a href="lexicon.html#koutra">koutra</a>. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> loved the sounds of these instruments; all younglings in Volare were raised with music at their lips
  and fingers.
</p>
<p>Lupin arrived then, taking <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s side. "Well! If it isn't the tongue wart of the Ilk!"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> grabbed Lupin's left ear and twisted it with a pull. "Think that if i keep your ear like this for a week that it'll shrivel up and fall off?</p>
<p>"OW! OW! I'll tell everyone you tried to cripple me before the big reveal!"</p>
<p>"They'll think you did it to yourself! You DO hurt yourself more often than anyone else in the village."</p>
<p>"Not on purpose."</p>
<p>"Why are your lips red?" <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> said, releasing Lupin's ear.</p>
<p>"Oh never mind that." Lupin said with a sly grin, while trying to get some feeling back in that pained ear. "Hey is my ear bruising? It feels bruised"</p>
<p>"Why would it bruise? I barely squeezed it!" <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> noticed the scarf then. "OH WOW– you're wearing your freaky scarf!"</p>
<p>"It's not freaky. Long isn't freaky." Lupin protested.</p>
<p>"I love it. Coiled around like that, makes it look like you have no neck."</p>
<p>"Yea, if I take it off my head will drop to the floor."</p>
<p>"Why did <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a> make it so long anyway?" <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> said.</p>
<p>
  Lupin shrugged. "In the end, <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a> just kept adding lengths to it without stopping, saying I would need it long. Never really gave me a straight answer when I asked why. Can't imagine how long it would have
  been if I hadn't hidden those last skeins."
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> laughed, relaxing for the first time in a week. A large crowd encircled them at the town hall then, the suns were about to set, it was time. Everyone around lowered their voices, and watched as the
  doors to the town hall opened. Lupin gulped. Even a funny-looking scarf wouldn't be enough to calm <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s nerves now, but even so, this youngling always knew what to say in such times…
</p>
<p>"Let's go inside–OH Venerable Nose Hair of the Ilk!"</p>
<p>"Don't say that too loud!" <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> chuckled as both entered the building. The crowd cheered, waving flags of blue and shouting their names.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  The town hall was a modest size, there were no mansions or grand palaces in this city, everyone lived as equals and this building was a reflection of this. The walls had murals painted on them, images of the Ilk as well as a depictions of
  their founder and great leader Volare. An embroided <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a> cloth covered the long table, sitting the village's council members, it bore stylized relief images of clouds and suns.
</p>
<p>
  The two cousins now stood before a row of 6 council members. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> was sitting on the far left, the elder smiled and waved at them. The 6 Veridos were nominated by the people and did not sit here idly, each had a profession. Ence, who sat next to <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>, was a skilled builder and helped in maintaining all of the houses here in Volare. Another two seats down, was a letterer, who would write their people's history so all could remember it. 
</p>
<p>Happy you could join us. Today, our <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> is retiring from being Voice, after many years of service,"<a href="lexicon.html#ence">Ence</a> said aloud, smiling at the two younglings.</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>'s left hand went to lie flat against the heart, "I will miss being at <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a>, but my body gave me clear signs that it's time to let someone else delight in this
  experience. I've learned much of the world through <a href="lexicon.html#vol">Vol</a>, our Ilk. I've no doubt that the new Voice will do grand things. I will be preparing to leap from the Ilk's snout in the coming week, I will want to
  speak to each of you before I go, you, whom I love." Saying these last words, <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>'s open hand turned into a fist. "I take this love with me to my death."
</p>
<p>"We will all bear witness to it, a leap is a grand thing." Ence said, visibly moved by <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>'s words.</p>
<p>Another elder spoke up then, <a href="lexicon.html#maliss">Maliss</a>, the head of the Volare nursery, "a grand thing indeed! A seed will be planted, and when grown, will be told stories of your accomplishments."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> smiled at this, as did <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>. Lupin remembered being proud on the day <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a> leapt off the snout, all others witnessing the event were
  smiling.
</p>
<p>"Balance in Volare has never been better, and it's all because of your work <a href="lexicon.html#maliss">Maliss</a>." Ence said.</p>
<p>
  "I've got <a href="lexicon.html#melanza">Melanza</a> to thank for this. If it were not for the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>'s teachings we would not be here." <a href="lexicon.html#maliss">Maliss</a> said, reminding others that
  the work of another had ensured their survival here, on the Ilk.
</p>
<p>
  Ence nodded at these words. "You are right, we have many to thank for it. Let us thank them in song." The councillor began to whistle, and all others in the room chimed in. The song was a re-telling of the history of this city and of its
  founders. Lupin liked to hear of the moment when the 3 founders — <b>Otora, Balandri and Volare</b> — first encountered the Ilks, the three giants were gathered at the foot of a mountain, grazing. Their leader Volare stepped up first,
  sure-footed, bowing at the hoof of the Ilk they now know as <a href="lexicon.html#vol">Vol</a>. The story was famous amongst the residents of Volare, but Lupin would listen to it again, and again without tiring of it.
</p>
<p>
  The singing came to a full stop. All in the room quieted. Councillor <a href="lexicon.html#ence">Ence</a> motioned for Lupin to continue the song in <a href="lexicon.html#ilken">ilken</a>. The candidates always performed the last chorus
  alone, as proof of their mastery of the language. Lupin did well enough, despite missing a few notes, while <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s performance was pitch perfect. There were other tests, which included recitations and
  improvised verses, again, <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> triumphed. Lupin's improvisations were noteworthy too, no one else could perform a verse as informative as the nutritional value of a
  <a href="lexicon.html#loomaroot">looma root</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Then, came the last trial, a reading of their family history by the city's appointed <a href="lexicon.html#reader">Reader</a>. Every Verido's skin bore patterns, a series of lines and dots, etched in deep, like veins on a leaf. Few could
  read them, here in Volare there was <a href="lexicon.html#pumra">Pumra</a> and <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a>.
</p>
<p>
  "Disrobe please," Pumra said, standing up and approaching Lupin first. The councillor was short, and had long wispy brows, it was hard to resist reaching forward to tie them up together in a bow; it was likely that
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had that same thought, a smile danced on both of their mouths. Pumra's finger traced along Lupin’s body, following the blue lines. "My mind has lost none of its precision, but these hands do tremble a
  great deal more than I'd like," the elder said in a whisper, looking more sad than angry. "I can't bear the thought of <a href="lexicon.html#patternreading">Pattern Reading</a> being lost to the world... how else will we know to read the
  names of those who haven't sprouted yet?"
</p>
<p>"I'll speak to <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a>," Lupin said.</p>
<p>
  Pumra was relieved to hear this, and gave a light nod to show thanks. The counsellor returned to reading, muttering names and words in a hushed voice for some time, and then the reading ended. “Lupin,
  <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a>, <a href="lexicon.html#laggra">Laggra</a> &amp; Lunav. <a href="lexicon.html#sproutling">sproutling</a>s of Volare, same <a href="lexicon.html#klorea">klorea</a> coursing through your veins. Very
  good."
</p>
<p>
  Then came <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s turn, Pumra followed the patterns, mumbling. The set of wrinkled hands then touched a patch of rough skin, a burn, the counsellor looked dismayed. “I cannot read you.” The finger lay on an
  old wound, carved there, on <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s backside. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> was distraught, recalling the event that caused it. Years ago, the Ilk stepped into a deep crevice - a rare occurrence.
  The violence of the motion made the city tremble. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>, a hot kettle in hand, lost control and the scalding liquid left a lasting mark on <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>.
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> knew what this meant, and began to sweat.
</p>
<p>
  “You know my family, we’ve been at the Ilk’s ear for three generations!” <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> explained, red-faced. “What does it matter if you can't read it? I speak perfect <a href="lexicon.html#ilken">ilken</a>, and
  have done everything you've asked of me!”
</p>
<p>The other councillors appeared saddened by these words, shaking their heads.</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> wanted to die. All present in the room knew the family, as did everyone else in the city. The Verido counsellors were people of great skill, but they were superstitious, and tradition was tradition,
  appointing someone with a muddy pattern, they said, would offend the Ilk. At these words, <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> froze. These words shocked Lupin too. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> sat with the other counsellors,
  silent, while the rest argued. The word "muddy" they repeated often, every mention of it hurt <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Then the council came to an agreement, but both candidates knew the outcome already. Pumra spoke up, “Lupin-" <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s eyes fell to the floor, avoiding <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>'s gaze, "you will
  be the bridge between us and the Ilk.”
</p>
<p>
  Both had undergone the same teachings, but there was never any doubt that <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> would get the role. "Can I refuse to be Voice?" Lupin wondered, "No. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> would never think of
  being Voice now, not after what they said..." There was no way to fix this. The festivities were already beginning. Things were moving fast, counsellor Ence was outside, announcing the good news. As per tradition, a ceremonial wreath made
  of braided <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a> hairs was placed upon Lupin's head.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin wasn't happy, and could sense the same in <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>. In an instant, a tiny defect robbed <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> of all purpose. To make matters worse, they'd called it "muddy".
</p>
<p>
  Pumra led Lupin outside to face the multitude, hands threw fistfuls of curled ribbons in the air and all began to sing. <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> stood in the crowd, still in plain clothes, a hand over the heart. Lupin
  yearned for a drink of kabacho then, to forget all this. Maybe <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> was right, staying home would have been better, for everyone.
</p>
<p>
  All in Volare chanted, repeating Lupin's name like a mantra. The next hour was a blur, a mess of people amassing close and saying kind things, the eldest of each family added a single bead to the wreath, after a while, the weight of it
  was giving Lupin neck pains.
</p>
<p>"You speak for us when you're up there! We trust in you. May your presence at <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a> grant us many more years on the Ilk's back," Pumra said, adding yet another bead to the wreath.</p>
<p>
  These celebrations were overwhelming, but it would not last, it was tradition for the Voice to climb to the Ilk's ear during the day’s festivities. The people would sing, dance and play games during that time, and await Lupin’s return the
  next morning. Wreath and all, the Voice climbed up to the ear alone, pushing through the tall tangles of hair on the spine.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  After a long climb, the new Voice arrived at <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a>, it was a calm day, no wind, all Lupin could hear was the faint noise of music of the happenings in Volare, this, and the sound of the Ilk's breathing.
  Even after being told many times what to do, or say to the Ilk, standing here now Lupin seemed to have forgotten it all. Before the Voice could say anything, the Ilk spoke. Lupin could hear wind circulating from within its body, and felt
  it coming up the throat before it pushed out of its mouth, creating a sound very much like a low horn. Paying close attention to the length and pitch of each sound, Lupin understood what Vol had said.
</p>
<p>"No wind" the Voice said, smiling, lips twitching. "I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous."</p>
<p>
  Another rush of wind, Vol's cheeks filled with air. Lupin listened carefully once again, expecting The Great Carrier to say something of meaning, but what Vol did say... was this: "<a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> vomited the first
  time."
</p>
<p>
  Lupin laughed, so hard that for a moment the Verido felt bad. "Sorry, that was rude wasn't it?". This, was their first ever conversation, all those other times the only practice was with <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> and
  <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a>. "I wrote a song for today."
</p>
<p>
  Vol's ear twitched at these words, listening closely. Lupin smiled, and pulled out a tiny instrument, it looked like a comb with flexible prongs. The Voice began to play a song with it, the Ilk seemed to enjoy it, its ears twisted at
  every second note.
</p>
<p>
  They continued speaking after that. The more time passed the more comfortable Lupin became. The Ilk spoke little of itself, it gave infrequent notice of changes in the weather or the terrain. Lupin spent hours listening to the whistled
  conversations between it, and the others of its kin. The other Ilks were far away, but wind carried the sound over long distances. It was nice to think that one could always know where the others were, they could talk everyday and be a
  family still. There were two others in existence, <b>the Ilk of Otora</b> and <b>the Ilk of Balandri</b>, two cities with Verido people. A comforting thought.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  The morning after the festivities were over, Lupin visited <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s house but couldn't get past the front door. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> guarded it well. There was nothing to do, and besides, it
  was better to give <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> some time to think. Instead, the Voice went to visit <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> was busy putting a pot together, grinding carapace shavings into a fine powder with a giant mortar and pestle. "<a href="lexicon.html#vol">Vol</a> is well?"</p>
<p>Lupin nodded. "Yea. I'm not though. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> has been avoiding me."</p>
<p>"Yeaaaa, well. Mago needs time, that's all."</p>
<p>"Did you know about the burn?"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> did not look at Lupin, and continued to pulverise some more shavings, "No. It's silly isn't it? This whole thing? Muddy-pft! What nonsense. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s lineage was clear
  as day." <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> mixed a handful of powder with crushed <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a>, and began to massage it into shape, gradually adding more water or more powder as needed. "You
  know, I'm thinking of becoming a traveling potter. I heard <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> love Verido pottery!"
</p>
<p>"You want to leave the Ilk? I thought you were learning how to be a <a href="lexicon.html#reader">Reader</a>? It's a dying art Ros, it'll die with you if you leave!"</p>
<p>
  "Land-dwellers name themselves, did you know this? <a href="lexicon.html#patternreading">Pattern reading</a>, as it is now, has become a matter of supersition. Vol doesn't care about patterns or
  <a href="lexicon.html#klorealines">klorealines</a>, WE do. We rely on half-baked rituals because we are afraid."
</p>
<p>"Afraid of what?" Lupin asked, but in truth, did not want to know the answer.</p>
<p>
  "That our future is not certain, and that your presence at <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a> doesn't guarantee a thing," while talking, <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> had already shaped the ball into a recipient, and was
  about to start carving shapes onto the outer sides of the bowl, but decided instead to reach into a bag for an object, which was then placed onto Lupin's lap. "Here, I made you a tea cup." A braid of
  <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a> was coiled around its handle, "You can tie it to your belt with it, carry it around, maybe have a cup at <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a>. Tea is good for thinking."
</p>
<p>"I already have a tea cup."</p>
<p>
  "Yea. I've seen it. This one is better." <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> grabbed the cup again, and set it atop Lupin's head. "It's a thinking cup. Forces you to look at the world, to question everything. If you need to have a
  long think, fill it with tea and set it atop your head. It works, you'll see."
</p>
<p>
  Lupin did not believe this. Not at all. And wanted to hear more of the uncertainty of their future on the Ilk, but in truth this mind did not want to think of it. "I don't need a cup of tea on my head to think," the Verido said, removing
  the cup from its perch. "I'll look ridiculous."
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> laughed, but said nothing else and continued to crush more powder, amassing enough material for a dozen more 'thinking cups'.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Everyday, Lupin climbed to <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a>. Everyday, with a new joke to tell. This was a challenge that resulted in many sleepless nights, Lupin was busy, hard at work composing jokes suitable for an Ilk. It was
  possible that they did not have a sense of humour, although some years ago, <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> had mentioned something Vol had said, something about a grain of sand and a mudbear at a snack bar. Ever since then, the
  cousins agonized over whether or not it was an attempt at a joke. Thinking about such times made Lupin miss <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>. Both hadn't spoken in weeks, <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>'s presence made it
  difficult.
</p>
<p>
  "You'd best stop coming, we don't want to see anyone," <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> said, dishevelled. Since the ceremony had ended, both had retreated inside their home and no one had seen them leave. The only person who had
  dared to visit, was Lupin.
</p>
<p>"That can't be what <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> wants."</p>
<p>"I don't like what you're implying," <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> said, eyes narrowing down, "you can't come here everyday."</p>
<p>"If you'd just let us talk, I'm sure I could help."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> was upset. "You saying I can't help my own sproutling? A curse has befallen our family and you're making things worse with your accusations!" Their family had always been Voice, this incident with
  the burn was disastrous. <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> felt responsible, but would not readily admit to it. "It's the Ilk," <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> said through closed teeth, "It meant for us to fail. Don't you
  see? It made me harm Mago! I will die with this pain in my flesh."
</p>
<p>
  Lupin could have wept right there, <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> was not well and it was likely <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> was worse. Was this the end of their friendship? They'd been playing together since they lost
  their baby leaves. Insisting further at this point would only cause them more harm, Lupin loved them and didn't want that, leaving was hard but necessary. The Voice thought it was a good time to go to the Ilk's ear again, Vol had
  centuries of experience, maybe it could offer some advice.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had heard everything. It was true that <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a>'s paranoia did make things worse, saying things like: "It's the Ilk's fault... it's the Ilk. It made me do it, I didn't
  mean to drop the kettle". They fed each other poison. One with this unending silence and the other with misguided accusations. This night ushered in a veil of unease in which many dark thoughts had time to take root. Every night,
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had dreams, it was always the same.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>
      "They were at the Ilk's ear. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had hands on Lupin’s shoulders, sharp nails digging in deep. Words sounded from <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s throat, but the voice was foreign and cruel.
    </i>
  </li>
  <li><i>"You asked the Ilk to burn me didn't you? It was you!"</i></li>
  <li>
    <i>The voice came from a dormant thing that had long festered inside this body, <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> smiled then, and pushed Lupin backwards and off the Ilk with surprising ease.</i>
  </li>
  <li><i>The body hit the side of the Ilk's neck as it went down, the bones cracked with every contact.</i></li>
  <li>
    <i>"<b>Crack, crick, crack!</b>"</i>
  </li>
  <li><i>Lupin seemed to weigh a ton, there was crick-cracking all the way down, like the body was coming apart. All sounds had vanished from the world, all, but the crick-cracking of Lupin's bones.</i></li>
  <li><i>When the body hit the sand floor, it cracked into pieces, like a brittle piece of stone."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each time <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> would wake, feeling nauseous and guilty, no amount of positive thinking could chase those horrible images away. Lupin was a friend, one <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> cared very much
  for, getting rid of this rage was more important than grieving. There was no telling how such thoughts could affect the mind. Already, there was an itch there, a dark sludgy patch that was hard at work assimilating
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s remaining good thoughts. No doubt <a href="lexicon.html#armyn">Armyn</a> too, had fallen prey to it. The only way to get rid of the sludgy patch, was to find Lupin, and to apologize for disappearing.
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had been a bad friend. It was time to move on, there were plenty of things to do on the Ilk, in fact, Lupin had hoped to become a <b>Hand of the Ilk</b> after the ceremony.
</p>
<p>"That's right, I could be <a href="lexicon.html#hand">Hand</a>," <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> thought. "I could do this and be happy... yea. I definitely could."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> finally left the house but did not find Lupin home. There was a lot of wind on this day. Wind rushed between the buildings, sounding like a long wailing cry, escaping from the mouth of a creature no
  mortal could appease. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> gazed up at the Ilk's head, most of it already engulfed in a thick cloud of dust, and concluded that this is where Lupin was.
</p>
<p>
  That morning there had been talk of a desert storm coming this way, people in the city closed their shutters and wrapped scarves around their faces - strong wind was dangerous sure, but breathing grains of sand was worse.
  <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> was determined to talk to Lupin. Upon arriving at the nape of the neck, the Verido tied one end of a braided <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a> rope around the waist, and the other to a security
  line. This line ran along Vol's spine, people used it to make their way up there safely. <a href="lexicon.html#thehands">The Hands</a> made use of these safety lines too, they'd been tried and tested and were deemed safe. The Voice
  typically carried a device on their backs, an extendable crossbar frame attached to a large fabric canopy with four straps running from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. Falling off of the Ilk was a common occurence, but descendants
  of Volare were in short supply.
</p>
<p>
  And so began the long, arduous climb to the head. The wind was stronger going up, but this wasn't <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s first climb in such conditions, and the line system was safe enough. The Verido pushed through angry
  tangles of Ilk hair, the central line ran right through it. While providing shelter, the hairs gave the climber something else to grab onto. No sand made it in here, though looking up one could see bits of grains whizzing by.
</p>
<p>
  Then finally, <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> pushed through the last section of hair and arrived to the top of the head. Lupin stood next to <a href="lexicon.html#theear">The Ear</a>, although from here the ear looked like a giant
  fuzzy plant, dark on the outside and pink on the inside. Once in a while the ear would twist, the Voice caressed it gently, in an attempt to calm the creature. There was little shelter on the head, nothing to keep the sand from grinding
  you down. This is why all who came up here wore thick clothing. Lupin's head was wrapped in a scarf, and a cloak rested upon these shoulders, this of course did not rival the Ilk's physiological adaptations. The beast eyes were cloudy, a
  third eyelid was drawn across it and acted as a protective curtain. A lot of particles lay trapped in the beast's eyelashes too, they too did a good job of keeping the vision clear, all of those tiny specks looked like insects trapped in
  a web. Their thick coats insulate them from the intense heat radiated from desert sand, and their gait and wide feet help them to walk without sinking.
</p>
<p>
  The Voice was too busy scanning the horizon for disturbances to notice anyone else was there. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> was waiting for the right time to step forward, but couldn't gather the courage to do it. Also, dark
  thoughts crept into this Verido's mind. How easy it would be to undo Lupin's tether. The wind would take care of the rest. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> chased the thought away. Horrified. <i>"What's wrong with me..."</i>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, their eyes met. Lupin's eyes showed through small openings in the blue scarf, a lot of the blue was speckled with yellow. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> was anxious, as if Lupin knew about that dream, the one with the
  crick-cracking of bones.
</p>
<p>
  Then Lupin turned back to the wind, and moved a bit of scarf away to reveal the smile underneath, just this was enough for <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> to build up the confidence to make that dreaded, but necessary apology. “I'm
  sorry I didn't congratulate you, and that I... that I-"
</p>
<p>"You should be Voice <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>, not me."</p>
<p>"Please don't say that."</p>
<p>"I mean it. The Ilk keeps correcting my <a href="lexicon.html#ilken">ilken</a>. It's embarassing."</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> smirked at this, but did not feel worthy of Lupin's kindness.</p>
<p>"We're still friends right?" Lupin asked.</p>
<p>
  They couldn't continue their conversation. The Ilk let out a groan, to warn them of an incoming gust. Both Verido braced themselves for impact, but the wind came fast and strong. Sand swept Lupin up into the air. A flurry of yellow grain
  swallowed up the world. <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> stayed put, belly on the ground with hands holding onto the main security line. When the wind died enough to stand up again, <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> hurried and
  grabbed Lupin's tether. "Hold on!" But there was a problem. The line was too light, like there was no weight on the other end.
</p>
<p>
  A sense of dread overcame the Verido then. "No, no, no...! This can't be real. It can't be. They'll blame me for it, they'll think I did it." <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> felt dizzy, and continued to pull. "This can't be real."
  Then came the end of the line, and no Lupin. Tears welled up in <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a>'s eyes. "LUPIN!"
