<blockquote>
<p><em>Hyroos are large creatures with big rounded ears and strong hind
legs. Their snouts are large, they can smell and hear things from far
away. These beasts are known for being able to run and jump long
distances with little effort, they grow in moist environments, although
they are thought to be extinct.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>    “Returning to the earth is good. There’s no pain there. It’s a
return to normality. Yes! Normality. I remember being grown. I couldn’t
see or smell… but I could hear things. Singing? Someone was singing to
me! Wow. I remember that..! Um. I wonder what else is rattling around in
here? Can I remember life as a seed? Or life before that? Ah. No, I
can’t remember. There was only darkness. Darkness is scary. How can I
know I exist without seeing or feeling anything? But wait, rocks exist,
and they can’t smell, see or feel… well at least I think they can’t.
Maybe that’s what it was like to be a seed, and before I was even made
into that, and before a rock was a rock. I felt nothing then, and after
I die I will feel nothing. It’ll be the same. That makes it okay doesn’t
it? Yea, it’s okay. This is okay. I’m okay.”<br />
    A great dark mass met with Lupen’s body, followed by a great wave of
pain. And then, nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seed, the light, we sow, we sow.<br />
A leaf, a child, I grow, I grow,<br />
My heart, my mind, hello, hello.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    Lupen, eyes closed, was becoming part of the desert once more.
Soon, Lupen would be just a word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Together, forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    Bits of rope lay in the sand. Small breaths escaped from Lupen’s
mouth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Below, below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    “It’s time.” The bones and muscles agreed, but the brain refused
to give in. “No one is letting go!”<br />
    “But we’re broken! It hurts!” The left arm and its corresponding
muscles cried out in pain. Then, came a rush of adrenaline, the body and
the mind stopped quarrelling and began to work together again.<br />
    Lupen looked around, but the Ilk was gone.<br />
    Lupen’s toes buoyed to the sand’s surface. “They’re all gone.
Everyone is gone.” Lupen wanted to cry. “Why didn’t I die from the fall?
This is cruel, too, <em>too</em> cruel!”<br />
    With the two suns perched high above, without cover or water, it
wouldn’t take long for death to come. “What is the point of
<em>this</em>!” The Verido cried out, angry at the desert, weeping at
the thought of never seeing Volare again. No tears came, the body
couldn’t spare the moisture, the skin felt tight, as if pulled in
different directions, crisp, broiled by the two suns. The scarf had
disappeared in the fall and moving to search for it was out of the
question.<br />
    I’m useless, Lupen thought. Then this mind became tired of
thinking.</p>
<p>    Lupen woke again later to more pain, and more sorrowful thoughts.
Although at this point, even the brain had too little energy and will to
conjure up anything positive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leaf, a child, I grow, I grow…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This song was soothing. Lupen’s cheek lay flat on the sand, eyes
unable to point skyward because of this heavy, heavy head, eyelids
drawing down over the eyes. “No wait, not yet!” Lupen’s yellow eyes
exclaimed, they’d found something moving in the distance.<br />
    An Ilk? No. Smaller than an Ilk, but big. Very big!<br />
    The figure was coming this way. “This better not be land sickness
playing tricks.”Now <em>that</em> would be cruel.”<br />
    The closer the figure came, the more details Lupen could make out.
There was a tall rider sitting atop a furry, large-eared beast. They
were enormous from afar, and even more so up close. The rider
disembarked and walked over, carrying a blue scarf. Levi’s scarf. It
looked tiny, held between the giant’s thick digits. A pair of heavy
knees crashed onto the sand floor, the stranger’s head towered high
above, obscuring one of the two suns.<br />
    “Hello Lupen of Volare,” the rider’s voice boomed, startling a flock
of Passari Tremblers.<br />
    The giant had dark hair, sharp facial contours, eyes like silver
marbles, and carried a thick yellow robe that resembled the desert. The
robe was as large as a dune, and could serve to shelter a fair-sized
group of people. The most impressive detail was the height of this
being, thin with proportions that dwarfed most. Now, those silver orbs
stared at Lupen’s broken body.<br />
    “How do you know my name?!” Lupen exclaimed, startled by the
stranger’s words.<br />
    “It’s written on your face, remember?” The rider replied with a soft
smile. “I’m Uno.”<br />
    The Verido was growing weaker, drifting in and out of sleep. Uno put
a finger on the side of Lupen’s head. “Look up at the sky. Protus is
out. Name all of the skyrocks that you know, loud so I can hear.” The
giant said in a commanding voice.<br />
    When Verido children were young, they’d make a game of naming all of
the known bodies in the sky. The names were difficult, so anyone who
could remember them all won the game. The majority of the skyrocks<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> were not visible to the naked eye,
but the children were taught that they were up there. No one remembered
who had named them, they just passed the names down through generations.
Protus was one of the moons in view now. Encela was another.<br />
    Lupen knew many of the names, but was too tired to remember them
all, “Baladavos.” A fear gripped Lupen then, was Uno here to carry this
body into the next world? Was there such a place? “Cencitris.
Naxagorus.” Was this giant the embodiment of death, or a hallucination?
There was a chance that the pain in this body was so grand that it
brought forth these visions. In a moment, these colourful visions of Uno
and the beast would vanish from the world, and the darkness would take
over, “Liminik. Omoretus.” The darkness did not come. Uno and the beast
were very stubborn hallucinations. Thinking about skyrocks kept Lupen’s
mind away from the growing allure of sleep.<br />
    Uno began unfastening sheets of rolled fabric from the beast’s back,
all the while humming a tune that reverberated all the way down into
Lupen’s core. The tune was soothing, like a salve, it helped to quiet
the pain, “Retna. Alpaninsis.”<br />
    Uno pulled out some long poles and put up a tent, then laid a
vibrant orange carpet inside it. Another bag lay strapped to the furry
creature’s side, Uno grabbed it and began to unload its contents. A
collection of herbs, a small kettle, mugs, some grains, plates, a crate
of waterstones<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> and a bag-full of other
miscellaneous items.<br />
    Uno walked back over to Lupen, “you’re only missing
Aristollo.”<br />
    “I’ve never won the skyrock game,” Lupen breathed.<br />
    “That’s okay,” Uno said. The giants scooped the Verido’s body up
with ease, and carried it inside the tent gently.</p>
<p>While Lupen slept, Uno stayed close, sitting at an arm’s reach,
reading through a pile of old books, a thick finger rapidly tracing from
the top to the bottom of every page. The rest of the time, Uno was
cooking and caring for Lupen’s wounds, leaving the tent every now and
again, but never for long.<br />
    At one time, Lupen noticed that Uno held a copy of A Tale of Three,
covered in annotations, but could not gather enough energy to ask about
it. Overcome by a sudden wave of fatigue, this body and mind agreed that
it was time for another nap.</p>
<p>“You look better,” Uno said one morning, offering the patient a cup
of lemilim<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> tea.<br />
    Lupen nodded, sadly, feeling better only physically, “yea. Part of
me does anyway. You don’t have anywhere to be? I feel bad to keep you
here like this.”<br />
    “Everything heals in time. The sand doesn’t blame the wind for
shifting it around day after day, and the wind doesn’t know guilt. Take
your time.”</p>
<p>    Uno was quiet, and did not always care to answer questions, but
declined them politely.<br />
    “Why do you carry so many books?” Lupen had asked once.<br />
    “They are my anchors,” was all Uno had said.</p>
<p>Like every other first sunrise they’d spent together, the giant
served tea, a mixture of medililly<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> and lemilim herbs.
“Great for circulation,” Uno would say.<br />
    Lupen did not know how much time had passed, but had noticed that
the wind outside was getting stronger everyday. A constant strong wind
in this area meant that they were in the gusty season. I’ve been here a
long while, Lupen thought.<br />
    All places in the Soronan Desert were gusty at some point or
another, but the Ilk walked with the wind and seasons, staying ahead of
the gusty time of year. The Verido people were blessed with good weather
all annum along. Storms could still happen on the back of an Ilk, but
they were rare.<br />
    Today, Uno seemed especially aware of the surroundings. After
serving tea, the giant’s silver eyes scanned the skies and the horizon,
before stopping on a mountain. “Drink your tea. You need to be in good
shape if you’re going to climb that mountain,” Uno said with a grin.
“That one.” A long finger pointed to a tall mountain in the distance, a
thick layer of clouds obscured it’s upper half, “all the way to the top
is what you said, right? Very brave of you.”<br />
    “What? I never said that. You’re crazy,” Lupen replied, “I’m better
than I was, but I’m not fully healed.”<br />
    Uno scanned the Verido’s body, stopping at the face. “You’re healed
enough.” The tall being spoke in a calm, inspiring, authoritative voice,
but those silvery eyes had the power to lull you into doing almost
anything, they could see past the flesh and pulled at your
insides.<br />
    “Why would I want to climb that mountain?” Lupen asked, eyes now set
on the mountain, wondering if it had always been there. Uno had cast a
spell on the world, the mere mention of a mountain had spawned one into
existence.<br />
    “My friend came back today,” Uno said, walking out of the tent,
“come, let me introduce you.”<br />
    Lupen felt too weak to stand, but Uno pretended not to notice.<br />
    “Come!” Uno insisted. Lupen stood up, groaning, hands grabbing onto
anything they could, crawling over to the entrance of the tent.<br />
    “Lupen, meet Kit!”<br />
    Images of a tall rider sitting atop a beast resurfaced. Kit was a
large big-eared creature. It had light-coloured fur with black spots
spattered all over. Two dark spots sat over its eyes, giving Kit a
constant air of severity and general discontent.<br />
    “I thought hyroos were extinct…”<br />
    It occurred to Lupen then that like the mountain with no name, Uno
was familiar. Lupen remembered a story with giants that towered above
the clouds and spent all their time admiring the passing skyrocks and
far away lights. They kept their eyes to the skies, but then one day, a
skyrock landed at their feet and they looked ground-ward, watching
sandstorms forming and dissipating. Green things began to sprout from
the ground. The tall ones witnessed this change with great interest,
they were delighted to see the green spread. They spent so much time
looking down, that they began to shrink.<br />
    “Foolish stories for fools like you!” A young Mago had said once,
“if there was anyone that tall out there we would have seen them!”<br />
    “It’s you,” Lupen mumbled, eyes fixed on Uno, unable to draw breath,
it was like the air had vanished from the world. Nothing in the
environment had changed. This was awe.<br />
    “What was it like in the early days of the world?” The Verido asked
suddenly, eyes full of wonder.<br />
    Uno laughed. A thunderous, but friendly laugh that did not confirm
or deny it. Lupen spent the rest of the day watching the ageless giant.
Uno’s head did not reach the clouds. Lupen tried to imagine what other
great creatures lived in the desert.<br />
    The nameless mountain came back to Lupen’s mind then. “I’m going to
climb you.” The next day, Lupen shared this intention with Uno, who
smiled and denied ever having introduced the idea in the first
place.<br />
    “Good idea.”</p>
<p>One morning Uno got up and began packing up the carpet, the herbs and
the waterstones. It was time to go. Before they parted ways, Uno handed
a copy of The Tale of Three to Lupen.<br />
    “For you,” the book was bound with beautiful red thread, made from
an unknown material. Even the paper was different, it was textured and
had a blue tint. “I transcribed it from a rare original. It’s all true,
all about your people. You’ll enjoy it.” There was another gift too, a
small sheet of fabric rolled up tight and folded over itself so that it
was now the size of a small loaf of bread. Uno also gave Lupen a single
short banabo<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> pole. “Fabric is hard to come by in
these parts. You can use it for shelter.”<br />
    “Thank you.” Lupen presented a gift too, Levi’s blue scarf. “My mapa
did tell me I would need it long, maybe it’s because it was meant to be
yours.” Uno accepted it, with many thanks said. It appeared tiny on
Uno’s neck, the piece of fabric could not go a full two turns around it
so the giant wrapped it around once. Uno took a liking to it straight
away, carefully rearranging the knot, as if handling the petals of a
flower.<br />
    Uno climbed up on Kit’s back, sending a flurry of sand flying around
them.<br />
    “Aristollo was an Iridi, and a good friend of mine, reminds me of
you, actually.” As the giant said this, right before Kit bounded up high
and far into the horizon.</p>
