<hs>Chapter 3</hs>

<p>
  Lupin marched towards the mountain, carrying a bag plump with supplies. <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> gave ample food for the difficult journey ahead, the bag contained a dozen <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a>,
  these would need to be rationed because these shoulders could not carry more. The bag also contained 5 loaves of <a href="lexicon.html#teaweet">teaweet</a> bread and some root vegetables.
</p>
<p>
  The climb was difficult, there was no evident road or path to take. Lupin climbed over faces of jagged rock, feet and hands finding cracks and creases for support. The Verido stopped often to eat, sleep, or to watch the world below get
  smaller, and smaller. The mounting altitude was comforting, like being on the back of an Ilk. The undulating terrain, that looked unfamiliar at ground level, was easy to recognize from up here. Lupin had grown accustomed to a flyer's eye
  view of things, it would be hard to get used to looking at contructions from their base rather than from their uppermost part, doing this would reveal different details.
</p>
<p><i>"It will be nice to rediscover things and places in this way."</i> Lupin thought.</p>
<p>
  The climb continued, and a new perspective came to view, one exceeding the height of any being in existence. If one were a colossus, this scene would be most ordinary, with a flick of a finger, one could brush this and that dune away, or
  pinch a new one into existence. This imaginary behemoth, if it so desired, could even pocket the suns and moons. Then Lupin remembered, that there were people down there too, and that they would not appreciate it. One could not move a
  mountain on a whim, not without causing much distress. Such is the curse of the tall, blind to the misfortunes of the little. This was sad to think about, and so the giant game ended.
</p>
<p>
  Many days into the climb, the environment began to change in big ways, thick wet clouds engulfed everything in sight. There was moisture in the air – a rare phenomena – Lupin took deep breaths of it. It was so thick, one could scoop it up
  and drink it from a mug. The low visibility made climbing troublesome, slowing one's pace was judicious, it wouldn’t take much to send you over the edge, a slip, or a rock breaking under your foot would do it.
</p>
<p>"One fall is plenty," the climber mumbled.</p>
<p>
  Many long days later, Lupin's hand reached up to find a grip, but this time, the hand touched greenery. It was a strange sensation. How can something feel cool and warm at the same time? Nails dug deep into the earth, like miniature
  grappling hooks. The Verido pulled, the stomach sliding onto wet grounds, flattening rows upon rows of blades of grass. Lupin rose, and gazed at the top of the mountain with no name. The summit was flat, more or less, and full of
  shrubbery and flowers, the smell was dizzying. Mesmerized at the sight of a bright purple flower, Lupin's knees met with the earth. The flower had massive petals, arranged in tight rows and bound together by a fuzzy yellow button, little
  droplets of mildew had accumulated on the surface of its petals. The droplets looked like jewels, but in a world of interminable desert, these were much more precious. It was difficult to believe this place existed.
</p>
<p>It’s here, that the Verido fell upon yet, another illogical creature.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Here, amongst the flowers and green wet leaves, a red-haired wonder lay in a bed of soft grass, asleep. It was a strange sight, this is the last thing one would expect to find on a mountain top. The wonder's pale chest rose and fell with
  every breath, pink lips curved into a smile. The red head of hair, created a hard contrast against skin so pale. All these things made for a most bizarre, yet wondrous sight. Veridos did dye their hair on occasion, but they were
  temporary, and never did produce a tone as rich as that. This creature was unlike all other races, with round ears and a complexion rivalling that of the moons.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin took a step back, keeping a line of tall grass between them, awakening to a stranger could be unpleasant. There was also the chance this person did not care for the company of others, why else would anyone venture up here? This
  would be a rather disappointing truth, coming up all this way to find it inhabited by a misanthrope. Lupin much preferred to think that this place was a refuge, a place of rest, or some sort of secret garden, and that no else but they
  knew of it. It was unlikely that anyone else would happen upon this place, when people left the safety of the city it was with purpose, not for sport. Your energy was a precious thing out here, over-exerting yourself in this heat could be
  deadly. Beads of sweat formed over Lupin's brow just thinking about it. The decision to come up here had been a careless one, whatever concerns the body had was not communicated to the brain before the climb, the legs and arms had been
  master of the body then, eager to prove they'd regained their former strength. It was that, or <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a>'s not-so subtle persuasiveness. Was the ageless giant aware that the wonder lay here?
</p>
<p>
  Maybe red lived here, but there was nothing around, no shelter, no fabric, no pots or table, not even a kettle! Around them, grew a ton of fresh herbs, pulsing, and caressing Lupin's arm, as if asking to be brewed. These nostrils could
  sense many different varieties, Lemoni lime, Bibiskiss, Blue plovies and <a href="lexicon.html#lickyroot">licky root</a>s, to name a few. There were other smells, new smells, that the nose could perceive but no more, it was difficult to
  put words to them.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin was excited to be here, every passing moment revealed something new and amazing. How grand it would be if the wonder would open its eyes, and bequeath its secrets. Lupin tried to think then, what question was worth being asked
  first?
</p>
<p>
  "Where's your kettle?" Lupin thought this one funny. "What is this plant? And that one? What about this one? Yes. So many plants to ask about, maybe I can take some home." The Verido paused then, but there was no more room for grieving in
  this heart, there was no point to it. Life had changed in a really big way, it was better to make the best of it.
</p>
<p>
  With all this thinking and speculating, Lupin thought that a long time must have passed. Soon, Red would awaken, but the position of the sun relative to the moons said otherwise. Such is the curse of the impatient. It wasn't proper to
  disturb the sleep of another without good reason, Lupin would have to wait for a cue, a yawn, maybe a stretch or some wrinkling of the eyes – all signs known to precede waking. After much waiting the sleeper still lay there, not a yawn or
  hint of eye wrinkling. This Verido would have to find ways to pass the time.
</p>
<p>
  The mountain was quiet, you could lay in green and watch the flowers undisturbed, doing this would occupy much of Lupin's time. There was an astonishing variety of plant life, some sat atop lanky stems with surprising balance, others had
  long green fingers, curved around bits of stone and neighbouring grasses. Collections of flowers sprouted forth from the ground in fireworks of colour, then, there was the beautiful rosary of dew drops accumulating on everything. Even the
  wonder's skin bore many of these silvery jewels, the result of the occasional droplet of water slipping down the centre of a leaf, and dripping onto this living canvas. The torso had a complicated motif all over it, like thousands of
  little wet eyes, with a big breath, some of the droplets would slide off, leaving small wet trails behind.
</p>
<hr />
<p>After many days, burdened by disquietude, Lupin decided to try and speak to the stranger.</p>
<p>
  "AHEM," clearing the cobwebs from this throat was the first step, “he-hello?" A quiet voice was key, no sense in startling this person into wakefulness. No answer. The voice would have to be a bit louder. “Hello?” Again, no answer.
</p>
<p>
  A fear gripped Lupin then, what if the wonder couldn't wake? What if this slumberer was stuck in a state of perpetual sleep? One could wait a few days longer to disprove this theory, or even some months more was not a problem. Dwindling
  supplies wasn't an issue, there was enough plants and water here to ensure good nutrition. Loneliness was a factor to consider, Veridos lived in groups and were seldom left on their own. Lupin imagined being here for years, this
  wonder-waking vigil seemingly unending. Could this be a trap? The allure of this mountain-top treasure would keep people here for ages until they were too fatigued to move, then, the plants would sprout from their ear holes and mouth and
  make a garden of their flesh. Lupin decided then that staying here forever was not an option, but leaving meant that the Verido would always wonder about the one asleep in the bed of grass.
</p>
<p>"Just a few days longer, then I'll leave."</p>
<p>A promise Lupin was sure to keep. This place was a wonder for the senses, a few more days would not be bothersome.</p>
<p>
  The air at the foot of the mountain was always thick with sand, but here, it was clear, and its perfume varied depending on the time of day. Maybe there was a flower guild, regulating smells using a timetable with slots allocated to each
  flower type. There was no need to cover one's nose with a scarf here, nor to cover skin from the harshness of the desert sun, Lupin had no need of a sweater either, it sat at the waist along with the vest that was underneath it. Lupin
  found a spot in the grass next to the wonder, and went to lie in it. Then sleep grabbed hold, and would not let go. The scent of the place and the softness of the bed of grass, a combination that could rob travel-worn visitors of their
  wakefulness with ease.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>
      Lupin dreamt of a city erected on the back of a giant <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a>. The inhabitants had braided the fur on its back into elaborate houses, patches of fur had been cut away to make space for people to walk
      unhindered. The leaflings would play hide-and-seek in the forest of hair, laughter all around. A hatter made elaborate hats from the fur, twisted into high spirals or matted into various geometric shapes. Life here was idyllic and
      peaceful, a thing of envy. Lupin was a <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a> whisperer and would go to the head to laugh and whoop with the <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a>, the whooping sound traveling far across the world.
    </i>
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>
      In this dream then, <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> arrived and spoke so loudly, that the force of it threw the city, along with all its inhabitants off the <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a>'s back. Again, the whisperer
      plummeted, but there was no end in sight. The <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a> leapt from one planet to the other, and bodies were adrift in space. This was not a fall, but a slow drift that would take you away into a sea of
      black, there were no stars here, the <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a> vanished in the distance. Shouting for help did nothing, the surrounding space was devoid of life. The suns had gone, this body did not feel the cold left it
      its absence, it was the same temperature as the surrounding air. Panicked, Lupin wept.
    </i>
  </li>
  <li><i>"Not alone, not again." The voice fell on deaf ears, but the fear was too great.</i></li>
  <li><i>"Not again!"</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then a noise propelled the Verido back into existence, the whooping sound from the dream was real! With eyes open, looking up, Lupin saw a large figure passing through the thick layer of clouds above, it landed opposite of the bed of
  grass, landing without a sound and without disturbing any of the droplets on the leaves. The beast had large round ears, like <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a>, in fact, it looked very much like <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a>.
</p>
<p>“K-kit?”</p>
<p>
  Sitting up, a cascade of mildew slid into the grass from Lupin's chest, and that fear of body invasion by plants returned, but these ear holes had no sprouts, the mouth and nostrils were also spared. How much time had passed? There was no
  way to know. Had the green garden acquired a new slumbering prisoner? Lupin knew how foolish this was. The glow of the suns through clouds was a poor sign of the passing of time over long periods. Perhaps the red wonder had arrived around
  the same time, and exhausted, had fallen here for a rest.
</p>
<p>
  The beast let out a laugh then, a high-pitched noise. It caused much of the droplets around to slide off their beds, this was definitely the sound heard in the dream. The beast was a <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a>, like
  <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a>, it moved over to the sleeping one and went in for a good long lick. And then, there was a yawn, some wrinkling of the eyes followed by a stir! A soft smile formed, lips curving and carving a new shape
  for the cheeks, arms and legs stretching out, then, eyelids slid open, pale hands found the tip of the beast’s snout, and moved to caress its large head. All the while, the beast kept its eyes on Lupin, the red wonder followed its gaze
  and stopped upon the stranger. Red eyes had found the intruder, unblinking, wild, and full of curiosity. They stared at each other for a long while, but a silvery voice broke the silence.
</p>
<p>“Can I have that?” Red asked, reaching forward and tugging at the sweater, the one wrapped round the Verido's waist.</p>
<p>Lupin blinked, and undid the sweater, handing it over without hesitation. Red slipped it on, then put a pink nose in it to smell it.</p>
<p>“Hmm! Smells like sand – and earth! I can smell the hands that made it! Ah – I love sweaters, they say so much about a person and of the world. Every strand tells a story you know!”</p>
<p>
  The wonder was alive, and full of energy. Nothing about this situation appeared bizarre to Red, any normal person would have asked for a name and why they'd come up here, but Red did not care to ask these things. Lupin had wanted those
  lips to speak words, but now that this wish came true this fool of a tongue had somehow gotten itself into a terrible knot – plus all this talk of sweaters was confusing. Red was definitely a treasure, a lost, and forgotten thing. All
  these thoughts had been so distracting, somehow Lupin had missed it, but the bed of green was short of a person. Red was standing up, looking at the flowers, body swaying from side to side, as if there was a song playing no one else could
  hear.
</p>
<p>The pale being then turned to face the stranger .“Are you ready to go? I’m dying to get down there to see what’s changed!”</p>
<p>Lupin swallowed hard. “Um. Wait. I have so many questions.”</p>
<p>
  “Later! All you need know, is that my name is <a href="lexicon.html#eka">Eka</a>, and that fuzzy beast is–" the wonder paused, eyeing the furry companion over for a moment, as if trying to remember something important "–
  <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a>! We are Eka and Hush!" Eka said, a hand brushing bits of red hair behind rounded ears. <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a>, the <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a>, let out a whoop, taking a seat
  next to its master.
</p>
<p>"I’m Lupin,” though something inside was saying that Eka already knew that.</p>
<p>Eka inspected Lupin's face. "Lupin. Yes. I like it. Will you be my guide to the world then Lew?” Without waiting for an answer, Eka climbed up on <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a>’s back. "You coming?"</p>
<p>
  There was a long moment of silence, but then an arm shot forward and gripped the Verido's collar, then, with a yank and a pull both were sitting on the beast. Eka smelled like wet grass, with hair so very red and short, a curtain of hair
  draped along the forehead and parted on one side, allowing those piercing red eyes to show. Seconds after that, <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> pushed off the ground with its powerful hind legs, bounding high and away from the
  mountain top, then, they started to fall fast, piercing the layer of wet clouds, the sandy world below coming into view. Eka laughed, while the other passenger tried not to scream. <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> made a few dampening
  landings, before paws touched the soft yellow soil. It had taken a long time to climb up there, coming back down so fast was rather dissatisfying. The wonder and <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> did not seem to care about this though,
  with all this excitement, came the realization that the mountain still bore no name. Combination of letters appeared in succession in Lupin's mind, forming words and possible names for it, but this was no time to make such a decision.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin was breathing hard, with hair standing on end, both slid from <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a>'s back then. Red laughed at the state of the Verido's hair and brushed a hand through to comb it back into place, this gesture was a
  surprise, Eka had no problem with proximity, keeping a pale face a few short inches away.
</p>
<p>“Where should we go first?” a button nose pressed right up and touched Lupin's.</p>
<p>No stranger had ever been so close, timid, Lupin's eyes became round, lips curled inwards, skin turning a deep shade of red. "W-what?" it was hard to keep oneself from stuttering.</p>
<p>"You're so timid!"</p>
<p>Lupin pulled away then. "Not timid. Shocked is more like it. This is weird, you were unconscious just a moment ago."</p>
<p>"Do you always call things you don't understand weird? If you want weird weird, look at this–" Eka's ears wiggled about, independent of each other, and continued, waiting for a reaction.</p>
<p>
  Lupin raised an eyebrow, not sure how to react to this. This Eka was strange enough, but there was no malice in it, the Verido smirked and began to move these ears in the same fashion. To finish, the Verido's flute ears unfolded and
  flared open, before twisting back into shape. Eka watched the trick, and laughed aloud at the end.
</p>
<p>"Here's something I bet you can't do." A whistle tunnelled out from the Verido's rounded lips, the sound was sweet-sounding and complex, it was a poem for the wonder.</p>
<p>
  Eka's expression was curious, a simple smile, but it would broaden and narrow down again depending on the words. Was it possible that Eka knew <a href="lexicon.html#ilken">ilken</a>? This made Lupin stop, and to turn to that familiar
  shade of red again.
</p>
<p>Eka clapped both hands over those red cheeks. "You flush so easily Lew! Here I was thinking that the Volare national colour was blue!"</p>
<p>"It is blue, I blame the lack of altitude," Lupin said. "Wait. Did you understand the song?"</p>
<p>"Something about a red flower, on a green mountain," Eka said, smirking still. "I'm flattered."</p>
<p>
  Lupin couldn't believe it, how is it that everyone out here understands <a href="lexicon.html#ilken">ilken</a>? The Verido was going to ask about it, but didn't have time, Eka had wandered off and was running through the sand, kicking up
  loads of it and laughing.
</p>
<p>“Do you know a city called Inepril?” Eka asked, kicking up more sand while exaggerating a walk.</p>
<p>It was possible the wonder had been asleep for ages, anyone else present would say that this behaviour was odd indeed. The Verido tried to ignore this, focusing on the question instead.</p>
<p>"Vol went by it a few years ago, not much left there. When the waterstone pit went dry everyone left."</p>
<p>Eka paced back and forth, making a mental note of this. "Um. Okay. Then <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> it is!"</p>
<p>"Sure. Why do you want to go there?”</p>
<p>
  Vol stopped there every year, it was a city that had grown large over the past few years. <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> was modern and exciting, but many thought it vulgar, even if they'd never laid a toe in it. The buildings
  were tall, and the population was dense, many important people lived there too. This is something Lupin had heard, or seen from atop the Ilk.
</p>
<p>
  “They make really good <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cakes there. Cakes paired with a fresh cup of <a href="lexicon.html#mepperpint">Mepperpint</a> tea.“ Eka paused, eyes closing with a hand pretending to hold a cup. "It's like your
  insides become green with it. Maybe they really do turn green, I've never checked."
</p>
<p>Lupin did not care to know whether your insides changed colour when drinking tea, but this was something new, and the world would have so much of this!</p>
<p>"I will get you a cup as soon we get there, and we'll fill your bag with it so we never run out!" Eka continued, before climbing back up onto <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a>.</p>
<p>Lupin laughed at this and took a spot on <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> as well. "So we'll live off <a href="lexicon.html#mepperpint">Mepperpint</a> leaves then?"</p>
<p>"No. No you can't. If you do, your eyes will sprout leaves."</p>
<p>Lupin fell silent, suddenly very afraid of <a href="lexicon.html#mepperpint">Mepperpint</a>.</p>
