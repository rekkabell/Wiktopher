<h1>The Sandfin</h1>
<h2>— Chapter 4 —</h2>
<img src="../media/content/flora.cactub.png" />
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Cactub is a nutritious, bulbous root vegetable. They spend most
of their time underground, and only emerge at dark to gather moisture
from the surrounding air. Cactubs are sensititive to loud noises and
movements, and they temporarily seize when panicked.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eka, Lupen and Hush wandered the desert, alleviating their thirst
with waterstones. Hush could no longer stand to have any weight on its
back and walked behind them, panting. They could not get to Montore fast
enough, though the thought of cake and tea did offer some motivation.
During the walk, Eka sang about babam cakes, listing the ingredients
aloud. Every song ended with a solo of groans and growls, courtesy of
Lupen’s empty belly.<br />
    “Ba-ba-ba-bam cakes! Ba-ba-ba-bam cakes!”</p>
<p>                                            ~</p>
<p>    <strong>Babam Cake</strong></p>
<p>    <em>Ingredients</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>    Ten babams<br />
    Two marima leaves<br />
    Two avoka nut pods<br />
    Three bushels of nutshroos<br />
    Six bunches of bobonions<br />
    Seven sprigs of dilly herbs<br />
    One bale of teaweet, stemmed and floured</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    <em>Instructions</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>    Remove skins from babams, and dice into cubes. Boil with a marima
leaf until soft. While babams are softening, crack one avoka nut in a
pan and saute diced bobonions and chopped nutshroos. Cook until all the
liquid has evaporated, then let cook until browned. Chop the dilly
herbs, add to pan with nutshroos. Mix together and take off heat.<br />
    Drain babams, mash with a stone mortar and let cool. Add teaweet
flour to mashed babams. Take a handful of dough and flatten into a disk,
add some nutshroo mix into the centre and cover with more bam dough.
Crack another avoka oil in a pan, and fry until golden, flip, and
repeat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>                                            ~</p>
<p>    “Please stop singing about food,” Lupen said.<br />
    They tried to ration some teaweet bread, but Hush, hungry, raided
their stores after the last second sunset. All five loaves had already
been eaten, the remnants now scattered across the desert floor. So, Eka
and Lupen sucked on waterstones, slowly drawing out the water.<br />
    “We’re going to die out here,” Lupen said, groaning.<br />
    Eka did not share Lupen’s concerns. “Haven’t you ever walked on foot
in the desert before? To those who know how to look, there’s always
something to eat.”<br />
    “Verido don’t walk on the ground,” Lupen said, every mention of
eating made the stomach whine again, “if what you’re saying is true,
then why aren’t we finding anything?”<br />
    “Because it’s too hot!”<br />
    “Of course, only idiots would be out here in this heat.”<br />
    “Oh! The things you say Lu, it’s like you’re not of this world! When
the suns set we should be able to find something.”<br />
    Lupen continued to complain, but in a hushed, low voice.<br />
    Then suddenly, Eka stopped, stomped on the ground a few times.
“We’ll set camp here,” Eka said, pleased with the spot.<br />
    Lupen was too tired and too hungry to ask why this spot was good, it
looked like any other spot of sand in the desert. Together, they built a
makeshift tent using Uno’s fabric.</p>
<p>After the second sunset, Eka took a seat on the ground just outside
their tent. “Lu. Pssst! Lu! Come over here!”<br />
    Lupen yawned, rolling over to Eka’s spot outside. Their tent wasn’t
very big, it provided some shade in the day but did not protect them
from wind, and most of the space under it was already filled with Hush’s
gigantic head—the beast could not be persuaded to move.<br />
    “What is it?” Lupen asked.<br />
    Eka pointed over to a collection of little stems nearby, working
their way out of the soil, their small, round leaves fanning out.<br />
    “Take the one closest to you,” Eka whispered.<br />
    Lupen came to sit beside Eka, and tried to grab it, but all of the
stems went to hide back into the soil.<br />
    “You’re terrible at this.”<br />
    “This? I have no idea what <em>this</em> is!”<br />
    “Lower your voice,” Eka commanded, “and be still. When the stems
come back out and the leaves open up, clap your hands together to stun
them, and then you can grab one. Haven’t you ever harvested cactub
before?<br />
    ”No,” Lupen said. “What’s a cactub?”<br />
    Eka laughed. “Only the best vegetable ever. Look, I’ll do it.”<br />
    Like before, the cactub stems emerged, and the leaves opened up in a
fan. Eka neared two hands to one of them, and then…<br />
    <em>Clap!</em><br />
    The cactub froze. Eka grabbed the stem and pulled it out. The cactub
was a bulbous root vegetable, purple and covered in little round nubs.
They peeled the skin off, and ate slices for dinner. Cactub was soft and
had many seeds.<br />
    “You can eat these too, or toss them. They’ll grow back from the
seed if you do that. For every two I eat, I toss one,” saying this, Eka
tossed one.<br />
    “Eat one,” Lupen said, chewing on a seed, “toss one!” The other
found its way back into the earth. They did this for a long while,
eating some, tossing some.<br />
    With food in their bellies, they huddled-in together to stay warm
and tried to get some sleep. Eka’s finger moved from skyrock to skyrock,
drawing a line between each one to make constellations.<br />
    “Salarus, Vitali, Neoneve…”<br />
    Eka found another skyrock in the distance, it was lying low, and was
brighter than all the others. A false star. Lupen had just dozed off.
“Lu! Something! Over there!”<br />
    Lupen turned to look, long-faced and red-eyed. “It’s dark. We’ll
check it out after the first sunrise…”<br />
    “Fine. You stay. I’ll be back.” Halfway through the sentence Eka was
up already and racing towards the point of light in the dark.<br />
    Lupen followed partly because somewhere within lived the fear that
Eka would leave and never return.<br />
They arrived at the low star, which turned out to be an avoka oil lamp
attached to the stern of a vessel, its bow lay half-buried in the
sand.<br />
    “It’s a sandfin!” Lupen said, circling it, trying to make out
details in the dark. The hull was painted yellow. It had a single wooden
mast, and two sails hanging limp from their ropes. Eka pointed to a
faint glow of a lamp from one of the portholes. Someone was
inside.<br />
    “Hello? Who’s in there?” Lupen called out, knocking on the
hull.<br />
    A thin-eyed, short thing, came peering out of one of the openings.
“Wai’re korei?!” a shrill voice responded. “Nono ask oo out derr!” The
voice repeated, switching from Finic to the Common Tongue.<br />
    The creature stuck its face in a porthole, the frame contoured it
perfectly, making it look like the sandfin had a head growing out of its
side. The creature was a Finiku. The Finiku’s hair was light and wild,
not a single strand seemed to point in the same direction, except for a
chunk of hair covered in pinny tar and coiled in a thick braid. Pinny
tar was a thick, black substance used to protect ropes on a sandfin. The
Finiku’s hands were also stained with it. Eka giggled, and watched as
Lupen approached the porthole so the Finiku could see better. Even when
standing close, the sandfinner’s eyes looked everywhere but in the right
place.<br />
    “Mai’ia! Noho’uta!”<br />
    “We’re not ghosts!” Eka replied.<br />
    “What? No. We’re fleshy people. We’re right in front of you! Can’t
you see us?” Lupen asked, perplexed.<br />
    “Iane. Too dark, too dark!” The Finiku disappeared below. They could
hear noises, as the owner of the vessel searched the cabin for
something. Then a beam of light flashed in Lupen’s face. “Verido de
yorala? Impossible. And?” The glow of the light shifted toward Eka, as
the Finiku searched for whoever this ‘Verido in the sand’ was
with.<br />
    “An Eka! Yora’nae!” Eka said with a smirk.<br />
    “Friendly?”<br />
    Eka nodded. “Friendly and fleshy”<br />
    “I’m not a mai… uh. Maya? Ugh. I don’t remember the word…”<br />
    “Mai’ia?” Nono said.<br />
    “That’s the one! I’m not a mai’ia. I’m a fleshy too. I’m a Verido in
the sand now.” Lupen felt uncomfortable and opted to change
conversation, “I’m Lupen.”<br />
    “The Finiku inched forward out of the porthole and smacked the
Verido in the head to see if it was opaque.”Orae. Nono now believe.”<br />
    “Ow!” Lupen stepped away from Nono’s finger.<br />
    Nono explained to them what had happened. “Sandfin fine, but it no
move! Why it no move!” Nono’s eyes widened saying this. Lupen saw there
was plenty of light in the cabin, yet the sandfinner claimed to see
nothing.<br />
    “Right. Well it’s too dark to do anything about it now. Come daytime
we’ll help you fix it.”</p>
<p>The next morning, Nono emerged from the cabin and stood on deck.
Lupen was up already, unfortunately sleep had not come. It was easy now
to make out Nono’s features, although their eyes appeared clouded, and
sickly.<br />
    Eka laughed, arriving at the foot of the sandfin just in time to
catch Nono trying to shake hands with Hush’s snout. “Nono, this is Hush,
who was asleep during our introduction.”<br />
    “I see, I see! Yora’nae Hush!”<br />
    They surveyed the damage. The sandfin lay over a rocky patch and the
rudder was gone, ripped out. Most of the hull looked fine, but the area
where the rudder had been was now a large gaping hole. Nono leapt off
the side of the vessel, and went to stand with the others. “Light kink!”
Nono said.<br />
    “A kink? You serious?” Lupen said, outraged. “There’s a giant hole!
You’ve got no rudder!”<br />
    “Ia’ia. No hole. Verido is crazy crazy from landsick.”<br />
    Nono’s eyes narrowed down to try and see the hole, then Lupen
arrived and helped the Finiku closer. “Big hole. Right there!” Lupen
said. The Finiku was unphased. It was only when Lupen put Nono’s nose up
to it that the extent of the damage was revealed.<br />
    “Ianae, iane, iane…” Nono’s head shook from side to side, there was
no stopping it.<br />
    Eka went to stand closer to offer moral support, and even laid a
hand over the Finiku’s shoulder to try to steady that tottering head.
“You have materials on board?”<br />
    Nono nodded, the shaking of the head had ceased then too. “Finiku
dey always ready! We make rudder. No problem. Nono have material, all we need!”</p>
<p>Once all three got to work, Lupen realized just how terrible Nono’s
vision was. “Who in their right mind would allow someone so blind to
captain a sandfin?” Lupen asked. Eka only smirked, gathering materials
from inside the cabin.<br />
    Together, they devised a plan to build the sandfin a new rudder.
They removed bits of the old one, took measurements. “You sure you want
to use this? You don’t need a table?” Lupen held a thick slab of banabo
wood, but then Nono walked up and began to mark it. “Okay then,” Lupen
said, releasing the table and reaching for a hacksaw stashed under a
pile of ropes. “It says ‘Maka’ on the handle.”<br />
    “Renate steel,” Nono said, “sosae’di de yorala!”<br />
    “Best in the land.” Eka translated.<br />
    Lupen cut the banabo board for the paddle, while Eka was carving an
old oar with a blade to make the new rudder post, and Nono was busy
retrieving bolts and nuts that would fit it. All the surfaces of the
cabin had something laying over top, and every crack was filled with
tiny stray bits of hardware.<br />
    Lupen was fascinated by the sandfin, they were a common sight while
travelling on the Ilk. The winged vessels looked tiny from up there, the
colour of their sails and the dust rising with their passing was all
Lupen could make out.<br />
    “What’s that?” Lupen asked, pointing to a barrel stored on deck,
“plumpkin juice?”<br />
    “Kapo.” Nono said.<br />
    “Poop,” Eka translated. Seeing the look on Lupen’s face, both
laughed.<br />
    Lupen had heard of this, but did not think it was true. Nono
explained that while the sandfin had no need of fuel there was always a
barrel stored on this vessel to give to others. “Montore fiendling, dey
say it ‘miracle fuel’, make life easy! Why use hand when derr is
masheen, dey say. Beobug<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> dey sell dis dream to Finiku, give
masheen… but wat appen when it break? No part to fix, no fuel. Beobug come fix, ask for coin! Beobug create… dependency, dae’na?
Before, Finiku depend only on sawa te kira!”<br />
    “Wind and sun.” Lupen said, happy to know that this mind knew a few
Finiku words. Everyone in the Soronan Desert used these two words. “I
don’t understand what Ilk kapo has to do with fuel.” Lupen said,
perplexed.<br />
“Beobug sandfin follow Ilk and take it! Den, Beobug process it on
sandfin. Very profitable! Nono mapa say, ‘If Nono captain Beobug
sandfin, Nono make good coin’,” Nono’s head shook again, “Mapa say dis,
but Nono is like grand-mapa Etyl, care only to sandfin. Nono listen to
voice of sawa te kira. Coin mawani’ia oro.” Nono said, putting a hand on
the heart.<br />
    “Coin has no soul,” Eka said, “Etyl is your grand-mapa?” That name
is known all over! First one to travel the whole of the land by
sandfin!”<br />
    Nono nodded. “Orae orae! Did it alone too!”<br />
    Nono repaired the hole, and completed the construction of their
makeshift rudder, fitting it to Etyl’s stern, all the while, listening
to Nono telling stories of the early days of sandfinning.</p>
<p>After a day of hard work, Nono tested out the rudder and saw no
problem with it. The hull was missing paint, but was otherwise
immaculate.<br />
    “Nono offer ride to Tiputa, come aboard!”<br />
    Lupen and Eka hopped aboard. Nono said that the sandfin could use
the extra weight at the stern.<br />
    They unfurled the sails and set course for Tiputa, plowing through
the sand, leaving a golden cloud in their wake. The sandfin was running
downwind, with two cream-coloured wings pulling it along. The wind
freshened, and the sands began to wash over the deck but handling a
vessel with a crew of three was easy. Eka made sure the sails had good
shapes, while Lupen kept an eye on the horizon, careful to avoid rocky
patches, there was no trusting Nono’s eyes. Nono kept mistaking dunes
for other sandfins.<br />
    The Finiku offered to make dinner, serving them something that stank
of pomparu with an unappetizing grey colour. Lupen joked that it had
probably been scraped off of the hull.<br />
    “Do you know many other sandfinners?” Lupen asked.<br />
    “Orae, Nono know many many, but Nono tink dey not so so good.”<br />
    Lupen’s mind conjured up images of sandfins in piles lining a city,
their hulls full of holes with squinting Finiku captains at the wheel,
unaware of the fact that their vessels lay broken and unmoving. “Light
kink!” They all said aloud together.<br />
    Eka could not believe that Nono was a bad sandfinner, no one trained
under Etyl could be terrible. After spending many days together they
noticed a pattern, Nono’s vision was worse after drinking from the
waterstone tank. To extract the water out of the stones there was a foot
pump in the galley, the pump pressed the stones down, funnelling the
water up a tube to the sink. Eka and Lupen, who still used their
personal stock of stones for water as to not to impose on Nono’s limited
supplies, deduced that the water was to blame. One morning they opened
the tank and found it infested with mudbears, tiny insects that burrow
in waterstones and secrete a toxin. Eka offered the Finiku waterstones
from their supply, and after a while Nono’s eyes cleared up.<br />
    Nono returned to the helm. The Finiku could read the sand and sky
well, and knew to adjust sails right as conditions changed. The sails no
longer sagged, the vessel was stable and soon they arrived at their
destination. On arrival, Nono thanked them for their help.<br />
    “Nono fill waterstone tank in Kippu. ‘It clean!’ dey tell Nono, but
not so, not so! Nono tink better to go back to help. Sick eyes… is
dangerous, dae’na?”</p>
