<p>
  Eka, Lupin and <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> wandered the desert, quenching their thirst with <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a>. <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> could no longer stand any weight on its back and
  walked behind them, panting. They could not get to <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> fast enough, though the thought of cake and tea did offer some motivation. During the walk, Eka sang about
  <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cakes, listing the ingredients aloud in song. Every song ended with a solo of groans and growls, courtesy of Lupin's empty belly.
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Ba-ba-ba-<a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cakes! Ba-ba-ba-<a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cakes!"</i>
</p>

<h3>Bam Cakes Recipe</h3>
<ul>
  <li><i>700 plbs bams</i></li>
  <li><i>2 may leaves</i></li>
  <li><i>2 avoka nuts</i></li>
  <li><i>350 plbs nutshroos</i></li>
  <li><i>115 plbs bobonions</i></li>
  <li><i>8 plbs dilly herbs</i></li>
  <li><i>50 plbs teaweet flour</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Remove skins from <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bams</a>, and dice into cubes. Boil with a may leaf until soft. While <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bams</a> are softening, crack one avoka nut in a pan and sautee diced bonions and chopped
    <a href="lexicon.html#nutshroo">nutshroos</a>. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated, then let brown for an extra 5 minutes. Chop the dilly herbs, add to pan with <a href="lexicon.html#nutshroo">nutshroos</a>. Mix together and take
    off heat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drain <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bams</a>, mash with a stone mortar and let cool. Add teaweet flour to mashed <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bams</a>. Take a handful of <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> dough and flatten into a disk, add
    some <a href="lexicon.html#nutshroo">nutshroo</a> mix into the center and cover with more <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> dough. Crack another avoka oil in a pan, and fry for 5 minutes until golden, flip, and repeat.
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>"Please stop singing about food." Lupin said.</p>
<p>
  They'd tried to ration the <a href="lexicon.html#teaweet">teaweet</a> bread, but <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> raided their stores in the night and all 5 loaves had already been digested. Both kept
  <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a> in their mouths, it helped in the absence of food. Saliva helped to draw out the water, in economical doses.
</p>
<p>"We're going to die out here."</p>
<p>Eka did not look worried. "Haven't you ever walked this desert before? There is always something to eat and drink."</p>
<p>"You know I haven't," Lupin said, every mention of the word 'eat' was the stomach's cue to start whining again, "and if what you're saying is true, then why aren't we finding anything."</p>
<p>"Because it's too hot!"</p>
<p>"Of course, only <i>idiots</i> would be out here in this heat."</p>
<p>"The things you say, it's like you're not of this world! When night comes we should be able to find some."</p>
<p>Lupin mumbled some words under breath, if anyone wasn't of this world it was Eka. It was true that this Verido, despite having read many books, did not know much of the desert.</p>
<p>
  They hadn't been traveling together long, but the Verido knew already that Eka didn't like to explain things. They walked for some time, and then stopped in a spot, that looked no different than anywhere else, to the untrained eye.
</p>
<p>"We'll set camp here."</p>
<p>Lupin was too tired and too hungry to complain. And so, using the chute, they built a makeshift tent.</p>
<hr />
<p>Come nightfall, Eka waited outside it, staring at the ground.</p>
<p>"Lew. Pssst! LEW! Come here."</p>
<p>
  Lupin groaned, rolling over to Eka outside. The fabric of the chute wasn't very big, it didn't make a proper shelter at all, just a small canopy under which they could lie. A lot of it was already filled with
  <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a>'s gigantic head, but the beast could not be persuaded to move. "What is it?"
</p>
<p>Red pointed over to a collection of little stems pushing out of the soil, a fan of leaves opened up at the ends.</p>
<p>"Take the one closest to you," Eka whispered.</p>
<p>Lupin went to grab it, but all of the fanned stems went to hide back into the soil.</p>
<p>"You're terrible at this."</p>
<p>"This? I have no idea what <b>THIS</b> is!"</p>
<p>
  "Lower your voice–" Eka commanded, "–and be still. When the stems come back out and the leaves open up, clap your hands together real fast. It'll stun them, and you can grab one – haven't you ever harvested
  <a href="lexicon.html#cactub">cactubs</a> before?
</p>
<p>"No," Lupin said. "What's a <a href="lexicon.html#cactub">cactub</a>?"</p>
<p>Eka laughed. "Only the best vegetable ever. I'll do it. Watch me."</p>
<p>Like before, the <a href="lexicon.html#cactub">cactub</a> stems emerged, and the leaves opened up in a fan. Eka neared two hands to one of them, and then...</p>
<p><b>CLAP!</b></p>
<p>
  Red grabbed the stem and pulled it out. The <a href="lexicon.html#cactub">cactub</a> was a bulbous root vegetable, purple and covered in little round nubs. They peeled the skin off, and ate slices of it for dinner.
  <a href="lexicon.html#cactub">Cactub</a> was soft and sweet on the inside, and had many seeds.
</p>
<p>"You can eat these too, or toss them. They'll grow back from the seed if you do that. For every two I eat, I toss one," saying this, Eka tossed one seed over the left shoulder.</p>
<p>"Eat one-" Lupin said, chewing on a seed, "-toss one!" The other found its way back into the earth. They did this for a long while, smiling with every mention of <i>'eat one'</i> and <i>'toss one.'</i></p>
<p>
  Now with food in their bellies, they huddled-in together to stay warm, and to try to get some sleep. Their bodies ached, keeping them all very much awake. Eka looked at the sky and the stars, a finger tracing along the visible
  constellations and calling them by name.
</p>
<p>"Salarus, Vitali, Neoneve-"</p>
<p>
  These names Eka recited every night before bed. The finger fell upon another star in the distance, lying low, and brighter than all others. A false star. It had taken some time for Lupin to doze off, Eka knew this but couldn't resist.
</p>
<p>“Lew! Something! Over there!”</p>
<p>Lupin turned to look, long-faced and red-eyed. “It's late. We’ll check it out in the morning.”</p>
<p>Eka had no intention of postponing this discovery. "Fine, you stay. I’ll be back.” Halfway through the sentence Eka was up and racing towards the point of light in the dark.</p>
<p>
  Lupin didn’t like this idea at all. In part because somewhere within, lived a fear that the wonder would leave and not return. This Verido had lost too much already, and decided to get up to chase Red. It was easy to spot that wild head
  of hair in the dark. They arrived at the low star, which turned out to be a light affixed to the stern of a vessel. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand.
</p>
<p>
  “It’s a <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>!” Lupin said circling it, making out the details of it in the dark was difficult. The hull was yellow, and flat-bottomed. Then Eka pointed to one of the portholes, there was the faint
  glow of a light. Someone was inside.
</p>
<p>“Who’s in there?” Lupin called out.</p>
<p>A thin-eyed, short thing, came peering out of one of the portholes.</p>
<p>“I am most fearsome! I'm warning you!" a shrill voice said. "Where are you? <b>Show yourself</b>!"</p>
<p>
  The creature stuck its face in the porthole, it contoured its large head perfectly. It looked like the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> had a face growing out of its side. The creature was a
  <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>, large-eared with a wide flat face. The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>'s hair was light and wild, not a single strand seemed to point in the same direction. Eka giggled, and watched as
  Lupin approached the porthole so the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> could see better. Even when standing close, still, the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfinner">sandfinner</a>'s eyes looked everywhere but in the right place.
</p>
<p>"Are you apparitions?! Where are your bodies! Oh no, no, no, no! Did I stumble into the <a href="lexicon.html#ashplains">ash plains</a> again? The sights I took this morning were no good! No good at all!"</p>
<p>“What? No. We're fleshy people. We're right in front of you, can’t you see us?”</p>
<p>
  "Much too dark, too dark!” The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> replied, disappearing below. They could hear noises, as the owner of the vessel searched the cabin for something. Then a beam of light flashed in Lupin’s face. “Hmm.
  A Verido and a–” the owner of the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> moved the light around, searching for whoever this Verido was with.
</p>
<p>“An Eka.” Eka said with a smirk, moving into the light.</p>
<p>“A Verido and an Eka. Friendly?”</p>
<p>Eka nodded. “Friendly and fleshy.”</p>
<p>
  “Your <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> needs some repairs?” Lupin asked, blinking to try and get the lights in these eyes to go away. The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> — that they came to know as
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> — explained to them what had happened.
</p>
<p>
  “<a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">Sandfin</a> won't move, I haven't the faintest idea why!" <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s eyes widened saying this, they were unusually clear and sickly-looking. Lupin saw there was plenty of light
  in the cabin, yet the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>ner claimed to see nothing.
</p>
<p>“Right. Well, come daytime we’ll help you fix it."</p>
<hr />
<p>
  The next morning, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> emerged from the cabin and stood on deck. Lupin was up already, in truth, sleep had not come because of last night's events. <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>s had a unique
  physique, they were short pot-bellied creatures with long droopy ears. Those clear sick eyes were disturbing, it was likely that <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> suffered from a bad case of cataracts. Eka too arrived at the foot of
  the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>, waving hello to its captain.
</p>
<p>
  "Oh oooh! You are bigger than last night Eka," <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> said, standing right near the <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a> and getting ready to shake hands with it. <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> let
  out a long whoop.
</p>
<p>"OH! OOOOh! What a morning voice!"</p>
<p>Eka laughed. "This is <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a>, was asleep last night during our introduction."</p>
<p>"Ah I see, I see!"</p>
<p>"See? Are you sure you CAN see?" Lupin asked mockingly, that <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>'s eyes definitely had a problem.</p>
<p>
  Now that light fell upon the vessel, they could see that it had suffered much damage. The <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> struck a rocky patch and the rudder was ripped out. Most of the hull looked alright, but the area where
  the rudder had been had a large gaping hole. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> leapt off the side of the yacht, and went to stand with the others to look at the wreckage.
</p>
<p>The captain stood 3 heads shorter than they. "It's just a light kink! Oh, oh, ooooh, why won't it move!"</p>
<p>"A kink? You serious?" Lupin said, outraged. "There's a giant hole there at the back of it!"</p>
<p>"A hole you say? No, no, no!"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> eyes narrowed down, to try and see the hole, all the while taking steps forward. Even up close, the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> was un-phased by the damage. It was only when standing a
  foot from it that the hole came into view.
</p>
<p>"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear–"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s head shook from side to side, there was no stopping it. Eka went to stand closer, as if to offer moral support, and even laid a hand over the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>'s shoulder in an
  attempt to steady that totttering head.
</p>
<p>"You have materials on board?"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> nodded, the shaking of the head had ceased then too. "Of course! <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>s are prepared for anything! We can make another rudder. No problem. No, no, no problem at all!
  I have all the materials, everything we need!"
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  All 3 got to work. Lupin realized just how terrible <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s vision was. No one in their right mind would allow someone so blind to captain a ship. Eka gathered materials from inside the cabin, and all 3
  began to devise a plan to build <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>’s <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> a new rudder. They removed bits of the old one and took measurements. The rough shape they drew on the surface of a thick
  board, which Lupin believed, had once been a dinner table. They found a hacksaw too, stashed under a pile of spare lines. It was a quality tool, made of thin but strong metal. The name <i>'Maka'</i> was inscribed on the handle.
</p>
<p>"<a href="lexicon.html#renate">Renate</a> steel!" <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> said, "the very best sort!"</p>
<p>
  By then, each had their own task to perform. Lupin cut the board, Eka was shaving the skin from a <a href="lexicon.html#banabo">banabo</a> stalk to make the rudder post, and <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> was busy retrieving bolts
  and nuts that would fit it. Tools and spares took up most of the space in the cabin, Eka wondered where <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> slept. They later learned that the sink was in fact a bed, all the bunks were dangerous due to
  the presence of lost bits of metal.
</p>
<p>
  "Tried to sleep on there once," <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> began, "but I woke up with a set of nails in my side." Saying this, the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> showed the marks they had left behind. Lupin gasped,
  noticing there was another bit of stray metal in there still.
</p>
<p>"Oh no, no, no."</p>
<p>
  The nail was taken out, somehow it lodged itself in there during the night. Even the sink was not free of dangers it seemed. All continued their work. Lupin was fascinated by the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>, they were a
  common sight while traveling on the Ilk. The <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfins</a> looked tiny from up there, the colour of their sails and the dust rising with their passing was all anyone could make out.
</p>
<p>“What's that?” Lupin asked, pointing to a green jerry can that was stored on deck, "plumpkin juice?”</p>
<p>“Best renewable and combustible matter in the <a href="lexicon.html#centralrim">central rim</a>," <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> said.</p>
<p>"Ilk droppings!" Eka said, then glimpsed the look on Lupin’s face and laughed.</p>
<p>
  Lupin had heard of this, but did not think it to be true. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> explained that while the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> had no need of fuel there was always a can stored on this vessel. Many
  towns had need of it, many used it for cooking fuel. And so, carrying some aboard meant that <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> could help out those who had no access to it - which was most people. The company responsible for the supply
  ships restricted access to it, but sometimes some of it would end up in the hands of people like <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>.
</p>
<p>
  "As a <a href="lexicon.html#verido">Verido</a>, you know, know, know how big Ilk droppings can get! <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> supply ships follow the Ilk and wait – they process it all aboard afterwards, very profitable
  business, very profitable! My <a href="lexicon.html#mapa">mapa</a> always hoped I'd work on a supply ship and would always say 'you would make good coin!', on and on and on–" <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s head shook again,
  recalling the things parents often said to their <a href="lexicon.html#sproutling">sproutling</a>s. "You are so like your grand-mapa <a href="lexicon.html#etyl">Etyl</a>, not a coin in your pocket and always out there sandfinning."
</p>
<p>"<a href="lexicon.html#etyl">Etyl</a> is your grand-<a href="lexicon.html#mapa">mapa</a>?" Eka asked. "That name is known all over! First one to travel the whole of the land by <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>!"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> nodded. "Yes, yes! Did it alone too!"</p>
<p>They completed the construction of their make-shift rudder and put it back into place, they also began work on patching up that hole around it. All the while, listening to stories of Etyl and the early days of sandfinning.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  After a day of hard work, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> tested out the rudder and saw no problem with it. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> couldn't believe it. The hull was missing paint, but was otherwise immaculate.
</p>
<p>"I have to make a delivery to <a href="lexicon.html#tiputa">Tiputa</a> village, you can come along if you like!”</p>
<p>
  Lupin and Eka were happy to join the crew, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> didn’t mind <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> coming along too and said that the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> could use the extra weight at
  the stern.
</p>
<p>
  They unfurled the sails and set course for Tiputa, plowing through the sand and leaving a golden cloud in their wake. The <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> was running downwind, with two blue wings pulling it along. The wind
  freshened, and the sands began to blow hard but handling a vessel with two more aboard was easy. Eka made sure the sails had a good shape, while Lupin kept an eye on the horizon, there was no trusting
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>’s eyes. The two crew members helped with navigation, making sure to avoid patches of hard soil. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> had no sense of direction, and kept mistaking dunes for other
  <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfins</a>. Despite these handicaps, this so-called captain was confident and blamed it all on bad light. One night the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> offered to make dinner, one they would
  remember for a long time. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> served them something that stank of <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a>. Lupin joked that dinner had probably been scraped off of the hull, their pained stomachs agreed
  with this theory.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin asked about other <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>ners, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> knew many, but made a point of saying that most were not nearly as qualified. The shock of that reply caused a chunk of looma
  root (a Volare favorite) to lodge itself in the Verido's throat. A few coughs and gasps and the piece flew across the cabin, and onto the wall. If <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> was the best
  <a href="lexicon.html#sandfinner">sandfinner</a>, it was terrifying to imagine what the others were like. Lupin pictured <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfins</a> in piles lining a city, hulls kinked-up and full of holes with
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>s at the wheel. All were sickly-eyed and yelling out orders while pressing a crew - that had long since mutinied - to get under way. The worse of it being that these sure-footed captains, were unaware
  of the fact that their vessels lay broken and unmoving.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> had brief moments of clarity, noting changes in the landscape with surprising accuracy. The crew thought it strange, surely there was no such thing as a condition that would better and worsen itself at
  random like this. Eka did not want to believe that <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> was a bad sandfinner. They spent a lot of time together on the vessel, and after a while they noticed a pattern.
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s vision was especially bad after drinking from the water stone tank. To extract the water out of the stones, there was a foot pump in the galley. The pump would press the stones down, the water would
  then be funnelled down a tube and come out of a tap in the sink. Eka and Lupin still used their personal stock of stones for water, and so one morning they opened the tank. It was full of <a href="lexicon.html#mudbears">mudbears</a>, tiny
  insects that burrow in <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a>, and that ooze a substance that contaminates the water inside. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> had been drinking bad water this whole time, it was the cause of
  these recurring bouts of blurry vision and disorientation. Eka offered <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a> from their supply, and after drinking from a
  good source the symptoms wore off. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s eyes no longer had that sick look, a pair of healthy orbs seemed to have changed the rest of the face completely. Eka went ahead and showed the contents of the tank
  to their skipper.
</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, no! That explains a lot! Usually, my passages are not so so so difficult! I thought this was due to the land of variable sands.”</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> laughed, realizing how terrible it would have been to not have met them, no doubt that the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> would still be rudderless. Lupin was against handing the tiller
  over at first, but Eka explained that the sickness was to blame and that all <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> were fantastic <a href="lexicon.html#sandfinners">sandfinners</a>. This was a fact, everyone knew this, most were born and
  raised in those vessels. It was in their <a href="lexicon.html#klorea">klorea</a>.
</p>
<p>They arrived at their destination, within a few days time. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> thanked them for their help.</p>
<p>
  “Must have caught those <a href="lexicon.html#mudbears">mudbears</a> when I filled up at that old waterstone pit in <a href="lexicon.html#kippu">Kippu</a>. The villagers said it was a clean source. It's possible that they too, had these
  symptoms. I do do remember the Kippuans running into still objects a whole lot.”
