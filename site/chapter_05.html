<img src="../media/content/fauna.pomparu.jpg" />
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#tiputa">Tiputa</a>, one of many towns of the <a href="lexicon.html#soronandesert">Soronan desert</a>. It is one road, with both sides lined by 5 triangular buildings, built with a slant pointing to the east, all
  businesses and all <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>-owned. The road's very design suggests that you will leave almost as quickly as you have entered, with every service just a short hop away.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#tiputa">Tiputa</a> is on low-lying land, tucked into a valley known for its incessant gales. Strong winds, known in these parts as <b>'Shriekers'</b>, pass through here every 10 days. During this time, all activity
  in the town stops, the flurry of sand it generates can be very damaging to one's lungs. It is because of these 'Shriekers' that none stay in town for long, most come to re-supply, or for repairs, and then take off again.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#tiputa">Tiputa</a>, along with other towns like <a href="lexicon.html#kippu">Kippu</a>, Inepril (now deserted) and <a href="lexicon.html#renate">Renate</a>, are built in windy places and exist primarily as relief
  stations for travel-worn visitors.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  On this early morning, <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> workers were outside with their brooms of dry <a href="lexicon.html#banabo">banabo</a> leaves. They brush the sand away from their storefronts, from the street, they dust
  their floor mats and polish their windows. All of this work will be undone the next day, but no matter, the task is then repeated and no one complains of it.
</p>
<p>
  Eka was wandering through town, looking at the stores and the workers. Everyone on the street said hello and waved, a diligent troupe of Finny <a href="lexicon.html#sproutling">sproutlings</a>, armed with brooms, furiously brushed the
  sand away from the main road. The strip splitting the city was made up of flat stones, though most times, they lay buried and unseen. Eka enjoyed watching the early morning activities of others, more enjoyable, was the sound the dry
  fronds produced when brushed against the flats of the stones. The <a href="lexicon.html#sproutling">sproutlings</a> were not aware of it, but there was a rhythm to their brushing. A song came to Eka's lips then:
</p>
<p>"Brush the sands, sweep the lands-", then Eka's voice got louder at this next part, <b>"-BRUSH, BRUSH, BRUSH!"</b>, and went lower at this last verse, <i>"sweep, sweep, sweep."</i></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>"Brush the sands,</i></li>
  <li><i>sweep the lands!</i></li>
  <li><i>Brush, brush, brush!</i></li>
  <li><i>Sweep, sweep, sweep!"</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Eka didn't see that someone was standing there, blocking the way, an old <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> with a long white river of hair, flowing downward and coming to a stop before splashing onto the ground. This stranger
  stared at the sweater, Lupin's sweater, wrinkled hands hovering close to it.
</p>
<p>"W-where did you g-get t-this?!"</p>
<p>
  Like all <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>, the stranger's body was short and circular. This character wore a red jacket and matching pantaloons, the jacket overlapped a shirt of delicate silky thread with frills at the neck and
  cuffs. These clothes didn't belong in a dusty place like this, the ensemble was worthy of a monarch.
</p>
<p>"I will do <b>ANYTHING</b> to get this shirt! What do you want for it?"</p>
<p>
  Walking away not an option. The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> was gripping the shirt now, feeling the threads with greedy fingers. Lupin's sweater was put together well, but it paled in comparison to this character's royal
  attire, it had no golden stitching or sculpted cuff links. Nothing of that quality.
</p>
<p>"SO! It's coin you want is it?"</p>
<p>
  With every question, and as desperation mounted, the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>'s stream of hair would spill out of perfection. Eka tried to back away still, but found the ancient thing still stuck to the piece of garment.
</p>
<p>"It isn't mine to sell!"</p>
<p>Most would think it easy to fend off someone so little, but the stranger held on, as if hanging from a cliff overlooking a fiery pit.</p>
<p>"Please! I must have it! I'll do anything!"</p>
<p>With all of that pulling, the seams in the bottom of the shirt ripped open. The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> let out a horrified squeal.</p>
<p>"<b>WHAT</b> have I <b>DONE</b>!"</p>
<p>Eka put a finger through the hole in the sweater.</p>
<p>"This is unforgivable! I–I am a fiend! I will make it better! Yes! I will mend it–"</p>
<p>
  Eka did not think it necessary, but the crimson-clad <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> would not listen and led the sweater – as well as its wearer – over to one of the triangular houses. This one had a red roof, even the outer
  walls were painted red, although the paint was worn, the sand had a nasty habit of scratching bits of it off in passing. Eka wondered if everything inside was also red, and began to fantasize about a house with objects, walls and floors,
  so red that they were indistinguishable from one another. A sign over the entrance to the house read '<a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> the tailor', with a handprinted sign underneath it with <b>'now retired'</b>. This sign had green
  lettering, this was enough to dispel the vision of this place being an a crimson funhouse.
</p>
<p>"You make clothes? Convenient."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Well – I used to. Watch your head!"</p>
<p>
  Eka nodded, taking note of the height of the ceiling before putting knees to the ground, walking inside like this was easy, if not a bit hard on the knees. Both stood –more or less – inside the tiny workshop,its angled walls filled with
  spindles of colourful fabric, between the spindles lay frames with certificates of past commissions for royals and other famous characters.
</p>
<p>
  The retired tailor grabbed a needle, and then a short length of thread from one of the spindles on the wall. The spindle was soon emptied, all of it now lay on <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a>'s needle. Then, time came to mend the
  sweater. <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a>'s hands shook with age, but steadied when the point of the needle came in contact with the shirt. The tailor moved with machine-like precision, the thread disappearing into the garment and the
  hole coming to a quick close. The thread on the needle was the same colour and material as the shirt, <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> had just enough fibre to finish the repair. In the end, it's like it was never ripped at all.
</p>
<p>
  Eka learned that the tailor used to live in <a href="lexicon.html#edonor">Edonor</a>, a place that - Eka made a point to say - made the very best Peachick pancakes. The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>'s great-great family opened
  a shop there many years ago. There was no doubting the popularity of the business, Eka glimpsed on the wall, a signed portrait of <a href="lexicon.html#bao">Bao</a>, the second Monarch of the <a href="lexicon.html#iridi">Iridi</a>. Many
  other famous characters had come to the shop, all left a signed portrait behind as proof of their passing. Because the shop was so popular, <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> had no time for anything other than clothes-making. The
  tailor had an itch to make different sorts of clothes, more <i>risqué</i> items, but the customers always asked for the same thing: copies of copies of copies, all copies of past works- nothing new, nothing exciting.
  <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> did produce different types of garments, but few asked for them. It was then, that this tailor decided that it was time to retire to Tiputa, where <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a>, a relative, now
  lived.
</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I'm not able to give this shirt to you, my friend's mapa made it you see. After I get some new clothes, it won't be mine to keep," Eka explained.</p>
<p>
  "I understand. I apologize for my untowardness. It's been a long while since I've seen such thread. But no matter - you need clothes? Well. I'll make you a set worthy of desert travel. I have a thread here that would suit you perfectly.
  Yes, yes. Come, come!"
</p>
<p>
  After picking out some colours, the tailor pulled out a numbered tape and began to take measurements. It took some time to get all of it, Eka was tall – unlike <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin's</a> usual customers. The red head sat upon
  a stool, putting an arm, or leg forward as required.
</p>
<p>"Can't say I've ever seen anyone with round ears like yours."</p>
<p>"That is due to centuries of erosion that is! Had ears just like you before."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> laughed. "You and <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> would get along, always has something funny to say that one." After jotting down all of the numbers, the measuring tape returned to its place at
  <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin's</a> belt, it was attached there along with a needle and a single bobbin of thread.
</p>
<p>"You keep these with you always?" Eka asked.</p>
<p>
  "Never leave home without them! These are the weapons of the tailor!" <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> went to stand on another stool, a hand over the heart. "As long as I breathe, no fabric will be left unsewn, and no pant leg left
  askew! I will not allow it!"
</p>
<p>Eka took a liking to <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a>, a talented and honest artist with a good heart.</p>
<p>"It will be ready in 2 days time," the tailor then said, with a shy grin.</p>
<p>
  As payment, Eka offered to help at <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou's</a> repair shop, <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> agreed, there was always a lot of work to do there, and with the westerlies coming in 3 days
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> probably had a long list of customers. They exchanged goodbyes, and Eka went to the repair shop. The place was small, again, because of its triangular shape, but could accommodate a few persons. Like the
  interior of <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono's</a> <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>, the workshop was brimming with tools, but in <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou's</a> defense, a small space was easy enough to fill. The repair
  shop owner glanced at the tall stranger, standing there at the door.
</p>
<p>"Need something fixed? Come back later. I've no time for it today."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> was dark haired, pale-skinned, with a round body enveloped in a pair of tattered overalls, these, were stained with grease and covered in holes. Those tears must be torture for
  <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a>, Eka thought, how did these openings escape the tailor's needle?
</p>
<p>"<a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> is making some clothes for me and I offered to help you here in your shop as payment," Eka said, knees on the ground and wearing a great big smile. "I'm Eka."</p>
<p>The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> craned a large head to one side, the top of the door obscured the stranger's head. "You really want to help huh?"</p>
<p>Eka copied the head motion, "Yea, is that weird?"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> laughed at this. "In this town it is, not many willing to work without the promise of coin nowadays. Well - no matter. Suits me. Hope you like grime, grease and grossness."</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> welcomed Eka into the workshop and explained today's chores.</p>
<p>
  "We got a <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a> problem, stupid thing lodged itself into the exhaust pipe of a <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>. Then, we got a busted water pump, person thought it a good idea to try and use
  it to press the juice out of an underripe plumpkin. Also got some trinkets that need soldering, then there's a rickety wagon outside that needs a new set of spokes, and the list goes on."
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> looked at what the outsider was wearing, and walked in close to touch the fabric of the sweater <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> had mended. For a second, Eka feared the same reaction in
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a>.
</p>
<p>"Blue <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a>."</p>
<p>The greasy shop owner's green eyes went round, they had a shine to them, glass-like, two beautiful glass spheres with minuscule herb gardens growing inside of them.</p>
<p>"Someone from Volare made this for you? I thought Verido never made <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a> garments for outsiders."</p>
<p>
  Not many people could tell the shirt was made from Ilk hair, even fewer knew that the hair of the desert walkers had a a subtle pigmentation, it could be either blue, green or red. This mechanic, with tattered overalls, had seen it right
  away. Eka wondered what the tailor thought of <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a>'s profession, they were family, yet their lives were so contrary.
</p>
<p>"This belongs to my friend," Eka explained. "<a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> was pretty taken with it, even made a hole in it."</p>
<p>
  "It's like finding the ghost of a friend at your door, a friend you thought dead." <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> said, fingers brushed over the area where the hole had been, no trace of it was left. "My grand-mapa Nok was head of
  shop in Edonor, somehow got hold of a spindle of blue <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a>, illegally no doubt. <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> inherited the business later on, but all the thread had been used up. Nok made a death
  suit with it, jumped into the Rupture in it. I'll never forget the look on <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a>'s face then, to have to watch a thread so fine fade into blackness. My mapa never had a chance with it, especially now that
  Verido don't trade it anymore. Thought you ought to know."
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> didn't give Eka a chance to reply, and walked over to a closet, pulling out a large pair of brown overalls and a mostly clean undershirt.</p>
<p>"It's dirty work, you should wear these instead."</p>
<p>
  The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> knew the value of that shirt now, letting it get covered up with grease would be downright criminal. Eka changed into <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou's</a> undershirt and overalls, the clothes
  fit, but there was much room in there, for another Eka or two. The knees had padding - to cushion the knees from hard floors - and numerous pockets to keep tools in.
</p>
<p>
  Their first task, was to try and get that <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a> out of that pipe. The <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> was moored out front, alongside it was the broken wagon, next to that was that box of
  damaged trinkets, and at the end of the line sat a very sad-looking water pump. Both moved to the back of the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>, Eka caught a whiff of the pomparu and gasped, hands jumped to cover up both the
  mouth and nose. Those creatures were renowned for their putrid smells.
</p>
<p>"Burns the nostrils doesn't it? First time I smelled it I couldn't eat for a week, everything I ate tasted like pomparu farts."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> grabbed a jar from a pantleg pocket, and dipped a finger in it, scooping out a thick glob of purple gel. Then without warning, the purple gel was smeared under Eka's nose, just near and around the
  nostrils. <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> already had some purple under the nose.
</p>
<p>"<a href="lexicon.html#lavendiri">Lavendiri</a> flowers," Eka said, the fresh scent helped to cover up the nasty <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a> fumes.</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> also had a thick scarf on to keep the smell out, and passed one to Eka. The scarf, was just enough to block the stink entirely, and kept the <a href="lexicon.html#lavendiri">Lavendiri</a> gel fresh.
</p>
<p>
  Both turned to the <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> then. The butt of the <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a> was sticking halfway out of the opening of the pipe, it had numerous sets of legs.
  <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">Pomparus</a> were plump creatures, pale-skinned and covered in colourful spots, the colours were hard to see because of the black exhaust stains. Pomparus were attracted to strong smells, this one tried to
  push its way inside the piping to get to the source, but got wedged into it. They were not clever creatures. It was common for people to make a pile of stinky rubbish outside of town to get their attention, and to keep them there.
  <a href="lexicon.html#tiputa">Tiputa</a> did have a pile like this, but this <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> had acquired the pomparu while on transit.
</p>
<p>"It's not dead is it?" Eka asked, noticing its legs weren't moving.</p>
<p>
  "If it were dead, the stink would be so bad that we wouldn't be standing here talking about it. <a href="lexicon.html#lavendiri">Lavendiri</a> wouldn't be enough, it would rot under our very noses. We'd be out in the desert, with our
  heads buried in the sand, but even that wouldn't help. My friend Fala found a dead one once, couldn't bear it. The only way out was to get rid of the nose. Fala chewed too much <a href="lexicon.html#kavava">Kavava</a>, wasn't right of
  mind at the time. <a href="lexicon.html#kavava">Kavava</a> makes you loopy." <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> said, telling this story as if it was nothing.
</p>
<p>Eka's eyes widened, imagining someone without a nose. "How horrible."</p>
<p>
  "Some would argue that no nose is better, when pomparus are involved. Anyway, I made Fala a prosthetic, to replace it, so others wouldn't stare. A beautiful purple sniffer! Fa absolutely adores it! Calls it <i>'my special nurple'</i>."
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> said this, hoping it would reassure Eka, but it had the reverse effect.</p>
<p>"Whatever you do, don't touch it with your skin. You can say goodbye to family and friends if you do. I'm telling you, that smell does NOT come off!"</p>
<p>"So, um. Shall we do this thing then?" Eka's nose was eager to move on to some other task, it had no desire to be replaced with a purple sniffer.</p>
<p>
  To get it out, both had to dislodge the pipe from inside the cabin, they took the whole thing out, then cut through the metal of the piping to shorten it. <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> covered the inside of the pipe with avoka oil,
  and reluctantly did the same for the area around the pomparu's body, all while wearing multiple thick pairs of elbow-high gloves, then, Eka shoved the small end of a broom through the pomparu-free end of the pipe, while
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> held it down with both hands. They could just throw the whole pipe away, bury it in the desert, <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a> and all, but that would be most cruel.
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> did not care to do such things. While Pomparus were less than ideal creatures, they didn't deserve such an end, no one did.
</p>
<p>"Ready?" Eka asked.</p>
<p>
  Eka pushed with such force, that the <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a> came flying out and went rolling inside of <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a>'s workshop. <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> shrieked, tore the broom from
  Eka's hands and ran inside, but it was too late. The floor was covered with a stinky green discharge. The slimy, curvaceous thing, was pushed with the bristled end of a broom, out of the workshop, out of the city – well away from all the
  houses. Already some of the villagers were outside, noses pinched and eyeing the stinker, all were afraid of what this smell would do to the town's businesses. They all scurried about, covering the
  <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a> drippings with ground Lavandiri leaves and other strong-smelling flowers, while others began to scoop it up with long-handled shovels and brooms, items they too, would have to discard after us.
  All had purple gel under their noses.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> took Eka's side, the broom was at the edge of town with that disgusting stink of a thing and marked where it was so no one would go near it. Those creatures were slow, and
  <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> had plans of putting a bowl of rotten muckwheat far out into the plains to lure it even further away.
</p>
<p>Eka looked at the disgusting drippings it left behind. "All this came from one <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a>?"</p>
<p>"Looks like I'm going to have to add 'burn workshop to the ground' to the to-do list."</p>
<p>Both laughed at this, although Eka wondered if fire would really be enough to rid the place of that foul odour.</p>
