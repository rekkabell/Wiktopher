<p>
  Lupin was hanging out at the local snack bar at the edge of town. Everyone had agreed to meet here later that day, so right now was all about wasting time. The owner of the town's only restaurant served the foreigner a local drink, a
  glass of bonan wine. <a href="lexicon.html#bonanwine">Bonan wine</a> was an alcoholic drink that people would frequently brew in <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> villages, every place had their own recipe. It wasn't uncommon to
  give some of yours to a friend, or to someone of importance, the restaurant owner Javi explained.
</p>
<p>Javi was proud of the wine produced here in <a href="lexicon.html#tiputa">Tiputa</a>, "best in all the land!"</p>
<p>"Think others in the land say this too of their wine?"</p>
<p>"Probably–" the restaurant owner said, "–but they're wrong!"</p>
<p>Lupin laughed. "I've had <a href="lexicon.html#bonan">bonan</a> before, cut thin and dried as chips, never as a drink. How do you make it?"</p>
<hr />
<h3>Bonan wine recipe</h3>
<ul>
  <li><i>1390 plbs of bonans</i></li>
  <li><i>20 waterstones</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Let bonans ripen for 1 week after harvest, cut bonans and add the squeezed liquid from 9 <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a>. Do not stir the mixture.</li>
  <li>After 1 day, squeeze the liquid from 11 water stones and bring to a boil in a hot pot. Add to bonans, and leave to stand for another day. During this period, fermentation will occur.</li>
  <li>Filter the water through a cloth, and consume the filtrate as bonan wine.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  Lupin spent much time conversing with Javi, that is, until Gree showed up. Gree was also a <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>, and captain of one of the supply ships <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> had mentioned. Gree's hair
  was licked back with such tautness that it caused the eyebrows to float higher on the face. By <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> standards, this new character was good-looking, and of good social standing given the uniform. Lupin
  imagined that <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> parents aspired to have leaflings like Gree, with a job that came with a title. One of the supply vessels was moored outside of town, it came in just a few hours ago, a huge
  double-masted <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> with a green hull, the name '<a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> II' was painted on its side in golden letters. The <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> sitting here now
  was in charge of <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> II, and was explaining how Ilk droppings were treated to be turned into gas to power machinery and vessels in <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>.
</p>
<p>"It's really quite simple–" Gree began, "–the gas is generated through anaerobic digestion to produce methane, it also undergoes a process where carbon dioxide is removed to improve performance. It's very exciting work!"</p>
<p>
  A worded speech by a devoted employee, sourced straight out of <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug's</a> hiring manual, Lupin thought. It was like watching a moving advertisement, especially with Gree wearing a matching company hat and
  ensemble. Lupin knew of this company, the Volare elders spoke ill of them most times, they thought it disrespectful to the Ilk to trail it in such a way. When in cities, the Ilk would be fed its weight in teaweet, then invevitably, came
  time to dispense of it- <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> was always there to catch it all. The younglings always laughed, watching the adults, as near to Vol's rump as they dared, to better shout down at them, forbidding them to
  take the droppings. Of course the ships and its occupants paid them no mind, and it served to amuse the youth of Volare.
</p>
<p>"Those accursed <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>s are out there again!" Pumra would say, "using excrement for energy, it's unnatural and downright sacrilegious!"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> was a big deal, it had plans to convert <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> to a fully-automated town. They tried to export barrels of it to other towns, but not many could afford it, nor
  had the systems in place to use it and instead relied on the wind for energy. The wind, as well as Ilk dung, was an inexhaustible source of power, but one of the two had a price tag. After Gree had finished paying hommage to the gods of
  <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a>, the captain threw an arm around Lupin.
</p>
<p>"You and <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> are good friends I hear! You came in on the same <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>. Small town, word travels!"</p>
<p>"You want something?" Lupin said.</p>
<p>
  Gree smiled, pearly whites coming into view. "You are bold, oh I like you! I'll get right to it then. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> is the most talented <a href="lexicon.html#sandfinner">sandfinner</a> I know, but package delivery is
  a waste of talent! <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> I needs a captain, I've asked and asked but have been turned away every time. I've asked too often! I need another to do it instead of me. I understand you have quite a title
  yourself, Voice of the Volare Ilk! Perhaps you could use some of that prestige to persuade <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>?"
</p>
<p>
  It was a mistake to mention being Voice – Lupin blamed the bonan wine. No one had ever said that being Voice was prestigious, perhaps it was viewed as such to outsiders. Seeing that the Verido seemed hesitant, Gree spoke up again.
</p>
<p>"You speak the language of giants! You have more authority than you think, using a title to get your way is perfectly acceptable."</p>
<p>Lupin's head was swimming. "Are we still talking about <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>? I don't understand why a title is so important."</p>
<p>"I sense a lot of hesitation in you. You are a grand being, and should be treated as such, others will listen to you if you make it clear to them who you are."</p>
<p>
  This, was an insight into <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>, a place where titles were important and where currency reigned. Perhaps Gree befitted the title of captain, but this did not mean that it could be used to dismiss or
  influence others Lupin thought.
</p>
<p>"I don't know–" Lupin said, attempting to move away but Gree's arm was as a solid and unyielding as an iron bar. "You really think being the captain of a vessel that recycles Ilk dung is worthy of praise?"</p>
<p>
  "YES!" Gree threw hands up into the air, as if in praise of some invisible deity in the ceiling. "It means limitless energy! My work shall propel <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> to such heights, we will be bathing in coin! Away
  with poverty and desperation, an age of automation and leisure awaits!" Gree said, eyes aglow.
</p>
<p>"Wind is free." Lupin said, "why bother with anything else? It creates smokestuffs doesn't it?"</p>
<p>
  Gree smirked, "Just a bit, nothing terribly damaging. You seem to think yourself taint-free, your people take a free ride on a living beast and have for the better part of the last 3 centuries. It keeps you from the worst of this world.
  You've no idea of the sort of life we ground-folk lead down here." The captain eyed Lupin carefully then. "Well, you are learning it now, aren't you? You're in the dust, with the rest of us."
</p>
<p>"The Ilk is a friend. We co-exist." Lupin said, trying to hide the anger brewing in this heart.</p>
<p>"That's what we're doing too, co-existing. Another glass Javi my friend!"</p>
<p>Javi went to pour a generous serving of bonan wine to both, a bit of it overflowing outside the vessel.</p>
<p>"The dung helps to fertilize the land, if you take it all, things will not grow." the Verido insisted.</p>
<p>
  "You do not think we really take it ALL?" Gree said, laughing aloud. "Even so, <a href="lexicon.html#foodpatches">foodpatches</a> solve all this, and are much better for you." The captain lifted up a sleeve to show one of those patches,
  pressed onto the skin, "This is my lunch."
</p>
<p>
  "Ah I see, another <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> industry. Another way to amass coin, a path to the creation of more titles." a glass of empty bonan wine sat in Lupin's hand, "did I drink all of this just now?" Gree's glass
  was also empty, but Javi was there to fill them right back up again.
</p>
<p>"Industry means progress." Gree said, leaning into the Verido.</p>
<p>"Progress means coin."</p>
<p>"Coin is the way of the future, Voice of the Volare Ilk, you'd best get used to it." Saying this, Gree smacked Lupin hard in the back, resulting in Lupin nearly spitting out a mouthful of bonan wine.</p>
<p>"What is there to do with so much coin?" Lupin said, coughing and trying to inch away from Gree, with little success still. "It's heavy, a burden really."</p>
<p>
  The Verido believed in trading, they did not accept coin for services or items, attributing value to a seemingly worthless piece of metal was a strange concept for them. Coin makes people crazy, for some reason everyone seems to want to
  amass a vast amount of it. Lupin tried to picture Gree in a bath of coin, and failed to see the enjoyment in it.
</p>
<p>
  "Coin is the measure of all beings, tiny medals of success," saying this, Gree pulled out a shiny golden coin, which in turn, found itself into the palm of Lupin's hand. The coin had a face printed in its centre, but the quality of the
  engravings made it hard to make out its features. The phrase <b>'<a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>: might is right'</b> was inscribed on it, and on the flip side was the number one hundred. Lupin was going to return the coin but
  Gree refused it.
</p>
<p>"Keep it, consider it payment for the little favour I asked you just before. You will take my proposition to <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> won't you?"</p>
<p>
  The Verido thought it strange to be entrusted with such a task, but with a gift of such value, with this coin that presumably had the power to elevate one's spirit in such a way, it was better to pocket it and to accept. Lupin would
  mention it to <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>, but would not insist on it. Just then, Gree said goodbye and stepped off of the stool, jelly-legged, and returned to the crew aboard <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> II.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin stayed at the bar then, couldn't put a phrase together. Javi laughed at the state of this stranger, "Have some muckwheat dumplings, they're stuffed with <a href="lexicon.html#bobonions">bobonions</a>, dilly herbs and
  <a href="lexicon.html#loomaroot">looma roots</a>. You Verido like looma roots don't ya? These will help imbibe all that wine in your stomach, lessen the effect." Javi pushed a plate of steaming dumplings in front of the Verido, "On me."
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Not long after, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> re-emerged from a client's house, content, and ready to relax. Now armed with a pouch full of coin, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> felt it necessary to treat the crew mates to a
  drink. All three gathered at the snack bar, savouring pints of plumpkin ale, although the Verido had opted for tea instead. Lupin had a headache, the dumplings helped with the jelly-headedness but did little to ease the other pains of
  drinking your weight in wine.
</p>
<p>
  Eka told them of the incident with the <a href="lexicon.html#pomparu">pomparu</a>, the fixing of the waterstone pump and all the other items on the list they'd been tasked with. Because of Eka's experience with the pump on
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>, it took just a minute to get it done. Today, they crossed many other items off that list, they managed 3 days work in just a day's time. Eka still wore the
  wide pair of overalls, large clothing was always more comfortable, even if they were black with soot and streaked with grease.
</p>
<p>Lupin spoke of the encounter with Gree, upon hearing that name <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s face showed disgust.</p>
<p>
  "AH! That <i>stink</i> of a <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> asked <b>YOU</b> to ask <b>ME</b> to captain that <b>monster</b> of a ship? Oh, no-no-no-no–" the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku's</a> head began to shake, the
  shaking did not stop for some time. Eka wondered if their friend was stuck in a loop and needed help, but <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> recovered moments after that. "No-no-NO is what I say and will always say!"
</p>
<p>"Being on a ship like that must be impressive, sounds like a prestigious post too. Why not do it?" Eka asked, the large ship at the edge of town was hard to miss.</p>
<p>
  "No-no-nobody is the boss of me! I enjoy my freedom." <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> said with pride. "I have no-no-no, desire to be packed into a tin can with a crew, nor do I care to stare at an Ilk's heinie all day."
</p>
<p>Both Eka and Lupin laughed at this. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> went on to say that they were both grown on the same plot of land, because of this Gree thinks them to be close.</p>
<p>
  "While I spent my young years traveling and sandfinning, Gree stayed in our home village and poisoned my mapa against me. Said I was wasting my time, that the only job worthwhile is behind the wheel of a
  <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> vessel."
</p>
<p>
  Not just this, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> explained that the <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> <a href="lexicon.html#sandfinners">sandfinners</a> were a crooked bunch, scamming at every turn and profiting from others. The
  company ships were also heavily automated, the captain did little but give orders.
</p>
<p>
  "Don't tell anyone, but I keep tabs on the <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfins</a>. <a href="lexicon.html#ponopo">Ponopo</a> watches <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> II, two other woths
  I have watch the others. I correct some of their misdeeds, which are there are many, those good for no-no-no-thing Beo-bums will not taint the name of <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finikus</a>. No-no-NO they will not!"
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  As the evening went on, <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> began to tell some <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a> stories, like the one about the notorious <a href="lexicon.html#dorake">Dorake’s passage</a>, a passage feared by many, one known to have buried
  countless <a href="lexicon.html#sandfinners">sandfinners</a> over the years. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> made the passage to teach the route to a young colony of messenger woths. <a href="lexicon.html#dorake">Dorake’s passage</a> was a shortcut to the southern dust
  plains, the woths would make better time if they used it. They only needed to do the route once with a teacher, after that, they would remember it for the rest of their lives.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> whistled, and called over a personal woth messenger, the creature was small, but looked tough. It had short antennae, as well as delicate yellow hairs all over its body.</p>
<p>“This is <a href="lexicon.html#ponopo">Ponopo</a>, carries all my messages home for me. Its traveled to many lands, knows most of the world routes!”</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#ponopo">Ponopo</a> fluttered off of <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono's</a> hand, and landed on Eka’s head.</p>
<p>
  “How can I get my hands on one of those?” Eka said, watching <a href="lexicon.html#ponopo">Ponopo</a> hover back down onto the table. Its antennae wiggled about, as it happened upon a patch of spilled plumpkin ale. These creatures were
  well known in these parts, the look of them was familiar, but Eka couldn't quite remember.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> pulled out a box, laid it out on the table and opened the lid. Six round eggs sat in it, laying over a soft blanket.</p>
<p>“Woth eggs.” <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> told them, “I always carry some around to gift to clients.”</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono's</a> hand reached into the box and picked up an egg. “They’re ready to hatch, but will only do so when matched with a person. Woths are loyal, they will follow you anywhere, even in death."</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> reached over the table and grabbed Eka’s hand, and placed a single round woth egg into the small of it. As soon as the egg came into contact with skin, it turned a sky blue colour.</p>
<p>“It’s blue!” Eka said, amazed by the unborn woth.</p>
<p>“Blue? They never turn blue. Yellow and white are the usual colours.” <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> said, looking very confused “No-no-no matter. Now, put a finger on the top of the egg, and do soft gentle strokes.”</p>
<p>Eka did as <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> instructed and put a finger on the egg, stroking it.</p>
<p>“The less strokes it takes, the better the woth.” <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> continued. A loud scream bellowed from the tiny body when the blue egg cracked open, after only a single stroke! “That is unheard of!”</p>
<p>Lupin and Eka watched as a new woth emerged from the egg, its body was blue. It’s antennae were long, and it had a quite a wingspan too.</p>
<p>“It looks so strong!" <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> said, shaking a head in disbelief, a reaction they had gotten used to by now.</p>
<p>
  Eka knew many things, but knew little of woths, although this one, did appear larger than <a href="lexicon.html#ponopo">Ponopo</a>. <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> grabbed a measuring tape and jotted down every detail, the colour of
  its fur, the length of the hairs and of the antennae, diameter of the eyes too – everything.
</p>
<p>“Next time I visit my friend's hatchery I’ll ask about this, they would know, they would for certain!” <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> put the tape away, and continued to marvel at the quality of Eka's woth.</p>
<p>“What should we name it?” Eka asked Lupin.</p>
<p>“Oh no-no-no! Woths name themselves!” <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> said, waving a finger at them. “The tricky part is trying to guess what it is.”</p>
<p>“How long did it take you for <a href="lexicon.html#ponopo">Ponopo</a>?”</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> took a long sip of plumpkin ale, after 4 pints the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku's</a> skin should have a red tinge to it, but it remained unaffected. “5 years. Thought of it after ingesting
  some bad herbs. Friend of mine though, poor fellow, took 20 years.”
</p>
<p>“20?!”</p>
<p>
  “Yes, yes! Named itself Mu-mu-mu-mu-mumford, that woth was a stutterer as it turns out.” <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> paused, only to give way to a loud belch. “They’ll listen to you with or without a name, but it strengthens the
  connection you know? Although, some think that perhaps the woths have no name, and are just waiting for the right one to come along. In that case, it means most woths are a fussy, fussy bunch.”
</p>
<p>
  Eka hoped it wouldn’t take that long, a 20-year long guessing game did not sound fun. “You’ve got an easy name, isn’t that right… Tom-tom?” a finger traced along the soft hairs on its back. The woth went about its business, and joined
  <a href="lexicon.html#ponopo">Ponopo</a> on the table to get some of that sweet plumpkin juice.
</p>
<p>"Tom-Tom?" Lupin said with a laugh, "It looks more like a Pino."</p>
<p>The 3 had an unsuccessful evening of name-guessing, after a few hours of this, Eka and Lupin said their goodbyes to <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> and went to raise their tent in a clear space on the outskirts of town.</p>
<p>
  “Would have loved to continue to travel in a <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>,” Lupin said, watching the unnamed woth wing its way through the air, drawing shapes as it did. They wondered if this was its way of communicating its
  name, but it turned out to be complete gibberish.
</p>
<p>Eka agreed. “They’re wonderful aren’t they? Wish the cabin was taller though, must have hit my head on the cross beam 10 times during the voyage.”</p>
<p>Lupin thought about something then, about name-giving, Verido had their names written on their faces but this wasn't true for everyone. "Did you pick your own name?"</p>
<p>Eka didn't answer right away, brows furrowing as if in deep thought. "Yes, I've had many names though."</p>
<p>"Do you remember being born?"</p>
<p>"Nope, but I have slept for long periods of time. I imagine being born is like waking up after a long sleep."</p>
<p>Another question burned at the Verido's lips. "What about dying? Where do you suppose we go after we're dead."</p>
<p>"We disintegrate, we become part of the world. I've seen it happen, again and again."</p>
<p>"What about my mind? Where do you think that goes?"</p>
<p>"Nowhere, and everywhere. It was like before you were born. That was an okay time wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Lupin shrugged. "Yea. I guess so."</p>
<p>
  "We're all part of the grand sweater that is our universe. We are a single thread and together we form a complex design, criss-crossed and stitched over one another into a variety of interconnecting patterns. Sometimes these individual
  patterns unravel, but they're not lost, they remain part of the grand sweater." Saying this, Eka began to unravel Lupin's sweater, tugging on a loose bit of twine.
</p>
<p>Lupin noticed this, and moved closer to help undo it. "I like this analogy."</p>
<p>"Analogy? You mean you don't adhere to the idea of a sweater-verse?"</p>
<p>Both spent the evening unraveling the <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a> sweater until it was back to not being a sweater at all, just a collection of thread.</p>
<p>"You'll be there to watch me unravel, I don't know how I feel about that." Lupin said, the bundle of thread in hand.</p>
<p>
  Eka leant over to rub noses with the concerned Verido. "You need to exist and not worry about such things Lew." Seeing that Lupin wasn't feeling any better, Eka locked foreheads with this stubborn worrier and spoke again. "How about some
  <a href="lexicon.html#bobonion">bobonion</a> soup?"
</p>
<p>"I'd like that." Lupin replied.</p>
<p>
  Eka cooked up a pot of <a href="lexicon.html#bobonion">bobonion</a> soup, which they ate with some slices of toasted <a href="lexicon.html#muckwheat">muckwheat</a> bread. Then, they recited poems about the sweater-verse until they feel
  asleep. Lupin did not dream of death that night, but rather of a world where everyone looked like a stuffed knit plush. <a href="lexicon.html#sproutling">sproutlings</a> made a game of unraveling each other's arms, while the adults
  scolded them. The sand was soft to the touch, with giant stitches keeping it all together; the vegetables were comically overstuffed, round and made of hairy fabric. Lupin was in this dream, and there, hanging from the side of this wrist
  was a connecting thread, connecting this Verido to an <a href="lexicon.html#aodal">Aodal</a>, to a <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>, a <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> a <a href="lexicon.html#loomaroot">Looma root</a>. This
  was <i>the thread</i> that bound all things in the known world and beyond.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  The next day, Lupin and Eka spent some time with <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a>. Since they'd finished all of their tasks so early, the repair shop clerk closed the store for the day and introduced them to some of the locals. They
  were treated with muckwheat bread, a local specialty. Everyone they came across would try and give them their own batch of bonan wine, they sampled some of it but when Lupin's words began to merge incomprehensibly with one another they
  decided it best to stop. One of <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou's</a> friends, had a few <a href="lexicon.html#vennec">vennec</a> babies and insisted on showing them off.
</p>
<p>
  Vennecs were large, humpbacked, furry beasts with thin snouts, large pointy ears and a long slender neck. The vennec babies were all asleep in a pile, it was hard to tell where one started and another ended. Though soon, the babies were
  on their feet and ran circles around them. Eka laughed, stroking their soft hairs. Lupin's face was buried in the fur of one of the larger cubs.
</p>
<p>"They're too young to leave, but in a year's time you're free to come back and adopt one," the vennec grower said. "That one is a strong fellow too, will be able to travel far with you."</p>
<p>
  Having a pup now would not be practical, they had much traveling to do with all the places Eka wanted to visit. Lupin liked the idea of adopting a vennec, and made a promise to return in a year's time. "You'll keep this one for me won't
  you?"
</p>
<p>The grower nodded.</p>
<p>Lupin caressed the vennec between the ears, "see you later then, little Aristollo."</p>
<p>"Aristollo?" Eka said, eyes wide and glancing over at the Verido. "But that's the name of a-"</p>
<p>"Skyrock? Yes, I know that."</p>
<p>"No. Well- yes. But it's also the name of an-"</p>
<p>"Iridi?" Lupin's mouth curled into a smile, it was nice to feel all-knowing for once, a rarity around someone like Eka.</p>
<p>"Yes again! WOW! Lupin you know everything!"</p>
<p>"I know of a hundred ways to prepare looma roots," Lupin began, "but I don't know the story of Aristollo. I'd like to hear it, if you know it."</p>
<p>Eka smiled, "It's better told through the mouth of an Iridi. We'll find someone to tell it to you, and on the way, you can tell me of the hundred ways to prepare Loomas."</p>
<p>"I really couldn't. Just the word itself, even after having just eaten, never fails to make me hungry."</p>
<p>"The muffled cries of your stomach pairs well enough with my singing." Eka said.</p>
<p>
  Both were making their way back to the camp, Lupin held a hand up to make a landing platform for the woth. That morning, they had received a little portable house for their new friend as a gift, a round glass ball with a gap at its side
  to be used as a door. Inside it was an inner wall of soft fabric, there was so much of it that the woth could easily find a spot in there and stay hidden. The ball was wrapped in yellow thread and had a permanent attachment to Lupin's
  backpack. <a href="lexicon.html#bou">Bou</a> had left the gift hanging at the entrance of their tent. Vacation time was a rarity in these parts, people worked all day everyday. Eka's help in the shop made it happen, and in thanks the
  <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> made a little something special for them. The woth landed on Lupin's hand, and then climbed down and found its way into the glass ball, burying itself in it.
</p>
<p>"Rest well Duster," but the woth did not react to this name either.</p>
<p>"Not even a twitch," Eka said, looking at the sleeping messenger, "it's a nice name, maybe it didn't hear it."</p>
<p>
  They weren't sure what the rules were, how would the woth react once it heard its own name? Maybe it would produce a sound, flutter extra harder, or maybe it would change colour again? Lupin wished they'd asked
  <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a> more questions, but the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> had left last night for another delivery, both suspected that Gree had something to do with their friend's early departure. The three
  had already said their goodbyes, and had accepted a gift of a bottle of bonan wine, which they guessed would be stronger than all the others they'd tried today given <a href="lexicon.html#nono">Nono</a>'s high tolerance to alcohol.

  The following morning, even before Eka had time to slip on some day clothes, <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> appeared at the door a bundle in hand. The clothes were ready and the tailor was eager to see them on a person. Eka changed
  out of these night clothes while Lupin brought the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> some herbal tea, served with a slice of lemoni lime and some grated sweet root. By now, word had spread in the village that the Voice of Volare
  was here, in a small town like this there could be no secrets. Gree had told others, and it made it to <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a>'s ear. The tailor was unusually quiet, and stared a the blue-faced Verido. Verido were rare in
  these parts, Ilk did not pass in this village given their size. They passed by Edonor every year, but there was so much to do in the shop that neither Nok or <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> had ever glimpsed it.
</p>
<p>
  Eka appeared before them, wearing a new set of clothes designed for desert travel. The trousers were loose, yet tight in the right places. They drew up over Eka's midriff and held there without the need for a belt. The undershirt looked
  plain to the untrained eye, but it was quality fabric (100% <a href="lexicon.html#banabo">banabo</a> fibres) and the stitching was reinforced around the neck and shoulders. <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> even made a scarf with
  sleeves, large enough to throw over your head for added protection.
</p>
<p>"You are a true master! These are wonderful!"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin's</a> face reddened at those words. "Oh it's nothing, really! It pleases me that you like it."</p>
<p>"I LOVE it!" Eka said.</p>
<p>The tailor had not noticed then, but Lupin had moved to the end of the room. The Verido came back with a large bundle of thread and placed it onto the <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku's</a> lap.</p>
<p>"Volare <a href="lexicon.html#isilk">isilk</a>." <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> said, voice high with emotion.</p>
<p>Lupin nodded. Just the night before, the thread of the sweater was re-bundled and bound with a matching blue ribbon.</p>
<p>"Now you can make something for yourself with it," the Verido said.</p>
<p>Just then, <a href="lexicon.html#orin">Orin</a> began to bawl, fingers curling around the precious bundle of thread. "T-t-this is too much!" there was no stopping those tears, "Y-you are t-too k-kind."</p>
<p>It was a great way to end their time here in Tiputa. The tent was packed away and they began their long walk to <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>, city of coin and titles.</p>
