<h1>An Oasis</h1>
<h2>— Chapter 8 —</h2>

<img src="../media/content/fauna.floater.png" />

<p>Lupin and Eka arrived near a hollow. They did not have to come through here to go to Montore, but Eka had insisted on it. This place, Nono had said, was dangerous to them. They were instructed to transit quickly, but their sore feet made walking fast difficult. The two experimented with walking fast, making much distance but getting tired faster, or walking slow, making little progress but with more energy to spare. When Hush was in a good mood, they would do a few long leaps ahead together, this too helped to shorten the trip.</p>

<p>Near the hollow, Hush spotted round creatures hovering in the distance. Its ears twitched, attentive to the faintest of sounds. Something was wrong. The hyroo would not move forward, fearful of the strange beings ahead. The creatures had two black points for eyes, long fluttery wings on the sides of their bodies and tiny slits for mouths.</p>

<p>“Whoa look at those! Had ballons that looked just like that on my last Green Day.”</p>

<p>Eka grabbed Lupin’s shoulder, “remember what Nono said.” These creatures, these floaters, were not unfamiliar to Eka, but little was known of them because usually people made a point of avoiding them.</p>

<p>Lupin did not believe they could be dangerous and took a step forward, as if to prove the rest of the group wrong. The creatures reacted to the intruders that stood near, they turned a solid red color and darted towards them. Eka leapt onto Hush and reached over to grab Lupin’s collar, but one of those creatures splattered like water onto the hyroo’s side. Another latched Lupin’s chest. Their bodies were sticky and soft like goo, but burned like hot, hot coals!</p>

<p>In a panic Hush bounded off, fast and far into the distance. Eka kicked at the soft gooey body to get it off, but the skin would just bounce back into shape. Hush landed with a roll, sending all passengers cascading onto the ground. The poor hyroo was rubbing its side on the sand and clawing at the parasite with its hind legs. Fingers and nails were not enough to get this spherical shrewbat to let go, Lupin had even tried hitting it with the butt of a mug. Nothing worked. Hush leapt into the air again, as high as Eka had ever seen it jump. The beast became a point into the sky, just another skyrock.</p>

<p>There was no way to help Hush now, and so Eka went to assist the other victim. The creatures had burned through Lupin’s vest and undershirt already. Lupin was in agony, body twisting on the ground.</p>

<p>“I can’t get it off!” Eka cried, trying to pry it off with one of the tent's crossbars.</p>

<p>Moments later, Hush returned, the parasite was gone but the skin where it had been had been stripped of all fur. This is how they would get rid of them: altitude and cold! Eka whistled for Hush and climbed onto its back, pulling Lupin up along.</p>

<p>“Take us up again! As high as you can!”</p>

<p>Like before, Hush jumped up high and fast. Within seconds, the creature abandoned its host. When they landed again, they were a good distance away, leaving those fluttery fiends behind.</p>

<p>Lupin lay on the ground, speaking through gritted teeth. “I should have listened to you. Those things! Why did they attack us?”</p>

<p>“They’re territorial, I know that, but there’s usually not so many together in one place.” There was some logical explanation, but right now Eka focused on a more important task: crushing waterstones over Lupin’s wounds, to help reduce the pain and swelling. The injury was covered with a dressing to keep air and sand from the skin’s seared surface. Hush had the same treatment. It was nearly nighttime, and with two wounded it was best to set camp here. After that ordeal everyone needed to have a good long rest.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lupin’s condition worsened in the night. Eka prepared some tea laced with herbs known to help in the event of infection, but was lacking many key ingredients. Most of the stocks they had were from Tiputa, but it being a small village meant that they had few good herbs to spare. Their travel party needed a place to stay for a while, staying out here was not an option and the next town was too many days walk away. Tomorrow Eka would try and search the land for the missing herbs, this was the only solution available to them.</p>

<p>Come daytime, Eka prepared nuni nuggets for everyone. Nuni was a starchy tuber with bright yellow flesh, it had a taste and smell that could best be described as being robust. Lupin loved nuni, but Eka suspected that the Verido enjoyed the way it stained the inside of your mouth more than its flavor. They ate many on the trip over here, and made bets on who’s mouth would be most yellow. Eka placed the leftovers, the skin and tips of the nuni, into a jar along with some brine, they'd be left to pickle for a few days and would be enjoyed as another meal.</p>

<p>The food was divided into 3 plates, but before breakfast could be served, a plump leaf-tailed orange hound appeared at the entrance to their tent, mouth agape, gushing with saliva. Eka wondered where this leafhound came from, there was nothing out here. Glancing behind the hound, Eka's red eyes locked onto a distant point of colour, a spot of green.</p>

<p>“Is that where you came from?”</p>

<p>The hound barked, and this triggered a series of faint yaps and yips, all coming from the faraway green smudge. By then, a pool of clear slime had accumulated at the hound’s feet, dripping from its long purple tongue. It was cruel to ask so many questions without the promise of compensation. Eka cut a piece of nuni and tossed it over, the hound gobbled it up, and waited for more. “You really like that huh?” Eka said.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served, although Lupin was in a feverish state and couldn't eat. Hush had no problem eating, and despite Eka’s warnings it helped itself to Lupin’s portion.</p>

<p>“Yea, yea. I know, I know you’ve got 2 stomachs,” Eka said, caressing Hush’s fur. “Listen Hush. Right now you’re the mapa okay? You take care of Lew while I’m gone.”</p>

<p>Hush’s ears twitched at the word ‘gone’. While not familiar with the etymology of the word it recognized the sound and length and associated it with a moment of absence, a thing it didn’t like. Hush let out a pained whine, its head coming between Eka’s hands.</p>

<p>“I won’t be far, just listen for me,” Eka said, fingers brushing the contours of the hyroo’s large parabolic ears. Hush yielded then, letting out a yip and taking Lupin’s side.</p>

<p>Eka smirked, and turned to the orange hound. “Let’s get going!”</p>

<p>Both walked out of the tent and proceeded into the desert wilds. The wind was down, and the suns were extra hot. The leaf hound followed Eka closely, well-aware of the existence of a secret piece of nuni, hidden anyway in the palm of Eka’s hand. Leaf hounds had a keen sense of smell, this particular one was dying to get at this last bit of nuni goodness. The leafhound stayed close, as if to make sure no one else would get it.</p>

<p>Gradually, the point of color expanded into a row of trees. In its center there was an islet of greenery interspersed with patches of color, each color corresponding to a different crop. There was no way that this place had come into being on its own, this improbable oasis was the work of a devoted carer. Looking further, Eka glimpsed a few of those horrible floaters hovering around the green piece of land. It would be impossible to go near it without them noticing. If one of them did, without Hush or Lupin around to help, Eka and the hound would be in trouble. The orange hound seemed calm, not bothered by their presence. Eka assumed that it had come through here once already, and yet it had not suffered any harm. Had they not seen the hound? Maybe it knew of another way inside, one unseen by them. Eka’s eyes were fixed on any movement in the oasis. There were many other leaf hounds there, one of them was chasing a floater that had wandered a bit too far inland. The floater turned yellow and backed away, returning to the outer parameter.</p>

<p>Eka had an idea then, the leafhound was their key to the oasis, and the morsel of nuni was the enabler.</p>

<p>Red returned to camp, the faithful leaf hound trailing behind. Using the nuni as a lure was brilliant, Eka thought. They would make their way inside with the hound, drawn close by the irresistible allure of the yellow tuber, and keep the floaters away all the while. They feared the orange guardians. Hopefully, this hound was frightful enough to protect all 3 of them and grant them safe passage.</p>

<p>Eka packed their tent and supplies, and the injured Verido was secured onto Hush. The group marched towards the oasis. Once there, they stopped and stood at the edge, waiting.</p>

<p>Lupin opened one fatigued eye. “Eka no, we can’t!”</p>

<p>“It’s okay, we’ve got a guide this time,” their fleshy guide was at their side, mouth dripping with clear juices. The last bit of nuni in hand. Eka stepped onto the grass, marking the entrance to the oasis. The spheres reacted. They raced over but did not attack, not while the orange mutt was there. Eka gave the leafhound half of the piece of nuni, it swallowed it whole and waited for the rest.</p>

<p>"Mind guiding us all the way in?" Eka asked, "I promise you'll get the rest, and more!"</p> 

<p>The hound yipped, and began to lead them deeper into the oasis. The spheres had all gathered around them, but left a corridor for them to walk through. Their skin switched from red, to orange and back to yellow. Lupin was hiding under the fabric of the chute, dubious about the whole idea. To their amazement, the round creatures stared, but did not try anything. They walked further inland, to a point they knew would be free of the threat of those things.</p>

<p>Eka was glad that they were safe, but then noticed the other hounds in the oasis looked at them. Their cheeks puffed up, but none charged at them, or made a sound, because one of their kind was leading them in. The other leafhounds concluded that they weren’t a threat.</p>
<p>Lupin breathed a sigh of relief, and Eka offered the rest of the nuni to the hound, caressing its head. “Good, good hound!”</p>
<p>Their troubles didn't end there. Someone was shouting from the house up the hill. It had been for some time, but in all this excitement they had failed to notice. A farmer came running, brandishing a rake. “How did you get past the hounds?!” But then saw one of the leafhounds chewing on a piece of Nuni, standing with the group of strangers. “Waldek, your insatiable hunger has doomed us all,” Waldek panted happily and wandered off, nose to the ground, searching for more food.</p>

<p>The Terin stared at them, dark-skinned and dark-haired, two-toed with thick limbs. A large rimmed hat shielded the wearer from the sun, a hat made from banabo leaves secured to the head with a cloth running along the top of the hat and tied under the chin.</p>

<p>Eka stared at the rake-wielding farmer. “I love your green place!”</p>

<p>Zucca was so furious that these words fell on deaf ears. “Leave! This is my property!” The owner of the oasis said, pushing Eka back with the tip of a rake. The hyroo growled and Zucca jumped backwards, rake and all. “A hyroo?” Zucca said, eyes aglow. “Such creatures are rare, very few were grown. Hyroos need lots of moisture! A temperate climate to sprout! How is this possible?” This was a creature of the old world, Zucca thought the hyroos had died with it.</p>
<p>Eka could see the farmer’s fascination for Hush, but right now they had more pressing matters. “Those things out there attacked us, my friends are hurt.”</p>

<p>Zucca was distracted, eyes fixed on the hyroo still. “There has been talk of receding genes, of sprouts hibernating in the soil and awaiting the proper conditions to sprout. Yes, yes. This is what must have happened,” Zucca paused, a frown replacing the expression of wonder, “staying here? Impossible!” Those words seemed forced. This fascination with hyroos came attached with a string of complications. More time with the hyroo meant more time with these others, these strangers. Curiosity and fear were at war with each other inside Zucca’s head, but the battle was lost before it even began. “You’ll have to go somewhere else,” and with these words, came the death of curiosity.</p>

<p>Eka removed the scarf, revealing a red head of hair, “time, shelter and medicine, in exchange for 3 questions about my friend Hush.”</p>

<p>“How do I know your answers aren’t lies?” Zucca spat out.</p>

<p>“You can trust me.”</p>

<p>Zucca was busy inspecting Red’s features carefully. The Terin then froze, eyes wide, having noticing the creature’s vibrant hair. Those eyes, and those same rounded ears, Zucca thought. The Terin spoke in a quiet voice, “same… but different.” Dirty digits scratched at the wood of the rake, nails brown with soil, there were bits of it on the clothes too. The farmer then glanced over at the sick Lupin, putting a hand to the Verido’s face. “Umph-” Zucca said, pulling away, “your friend had another accident, before this one I mean.”</p>

<p>Eka nodded. “Yea, fell off an Ilk.”</p>

<p>“Well, that explains it. No Verido in their right mind would choose to leave an Ilk. And before that?”</p>
<p>Eka shrugged. “I wasn’t there before that, but now that I think of it, my friend is very accident prone. Not a lot of world experience, if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>Zucca took a deep breath. “You can stay, but you can’t wander around my grounds without me saying so, and you can’t touch ANYTHING unless given to you. Is that clear?”</p>

<p>Eka nodded in thanks, Lupin breathed out a thank you as well. The injured Verido was sweating profusely, eyelids appeared heavy, drawn down by many tiny invisible hands.</p>

<p>“Pomparu for president!” Lupin said.</p>

<p>Eka was concerned. “My friend is delusional. I need some medililly herbs to treat the wounds, and fast!”</p>
<p>Zucca promised to bring some over later. “Don’t. Touch. Anything.” After this, the grouch returned to the house atop the hill.</p>

<p>Eka looked pleased. If one took note of the subtleties in Zucca’s mannerisms and speech, they would conclude that the Terin was a mess of contradictory emotions. A reluctant, overprotective and intermittently sympathetic character. Staying here meant that they would have to respect the rules of the oasis and its owner.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eka raised their tent, helped Lupin inside and sat down to watch the orange dogs walking the fields. They looked at every single crop, their antennae prodding them gently, as if they were asking them about their health. The oasis was divided into many parts. The front had fresh produce, like karrots and bams. Fields of teaweet and other grains sat in between the vegetables and the small cabin atop the hill. Eka could see a space contoured by tall hedges behind that, their height made it impossible to see what was inside. Zucca was a busy fellow, Eka could see the farmer building another house at the northern edge of the field.</p>

<p>Waldek was around still, despite the absence of nuni. Perhaps its visit to their camp that morning was due to curiosity, or maybe kindness. Maybe the hound knew of the attack, and had purposely come to lead them to a safe place. Eka visited the patients often. Hush was reacted well to the treatment, although it wasn't not its usual, hungry self.</p>

<p>Zucca’s gravelly voice sounded outside. “Hey-” there was a pause, they hadn’t introduced each other by name yet, “hey uh. Hey you! In the tent!”</p>

<p>Eka wandered out. “You can call me Eka, and that trumpet-eared invalid in there is Lew-pee-lew.”</p>

<p>“Lew-pee-lew? That sounds made up.”</p>

<p>Eka nodded. “I’m sure you know how eccentric Verido can be Zucca, you’ve heard the stories.”</p>
<p>“How do you know my name?!”</p>

<p>“Oh your hound Waldek told me. Well, through Hush because I don’t speak leafhound. Not well anyway, I always mix up the subtleties in the yaps. Don’t get me started on the yips! It’s a very tonal language, not easy to master, and there are SO many dialects!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like lies, or jokes,” Zucca began, “I’m going to apply your friend’s medicine. I don’t want to hear any more nonsense.”</p>

<p>Eka glanced at Waldek then, "Hey, I thought you said Zucca liked jokes."</p>

<p>Waldek yipped, panting loudly.</p>

<p>"Only early in the morning, I see, I see..." Eka said, taking a mental note.</p> 

<p>Zucca ignored them both, busy preparing medililly poultices. The soft, moist mass was applied to Lupin and Hush's wounds, and wrapped carefully with a clean strip of cloth.</p>

<p>“What is the name of mountain you spoke of, where the hyroos grow? It’s within the belt isn’t it?” Zucca asked, eyes set on the hyroo. The large-eared creature was asleep, coiled into a tight ball with its head hidden. Its back expanded and contracted with every breath. Zucca put a hand to the hyroo’s side, inspecting its fur.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t got one, places without names remain strangely unseen.”</p>

<p>“You won’t say,” Zucca paused. “You think I’ll tell? Whom shall I divulge this to I wonder?”</p>

<p>“I’m telling you the truth. It hasn’t got one.”</p>

<p>“Okay. Fine.” Zucca was displeased with this answer. “How long do hyroos live for?”</p>

<p>“A hundred years? Maybe?”</p>

<p>“And how old is Hush?”</p>

<p>“Less than a year old I’d say. Hush is very green,” saying this, Eka turned to caress the back of the hyroo.</p>

<p>“They grow that big in just one year? Remarkable.”</p>

<p>“That makes 3 questions!”</p>

<p>“No, no. That first one doesn’t count. I didn’t get an answer.” Zucca said.</p>

<p>Eka thought about this for a moment, then shrugged, “okay, you get a redo.”</p>

<p>Zucca nodded before leaving the tent, that last question needed to be pondered carefully.</p>

<p>The next day, Hush was sitting outside the tent with Waldek, healthy, gnawing on a stalk of gingin root. During the night, their leaf-tailed guide had rounded up a pile of fresh produce for them. Zucca’s words came to mind then: “Take only what is given to you.” Eka smirked at this, the Terin hadn’t intended on Waldek bringing food over, but technically, they weren’t breaking any rules. The orange critter let out a yip before returning to its meal, it had helped itself to some of the items in the pile. Eka gathered some produce and began to cook breakfast.</p>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>“I present you toast! Eka style!” Eka said, presenting this tasty creation to the bed-bound Verido.</p>

<p>Lupin was awake, and was looking much better than yesterday. “Whoa fresh mapples! Surprised Zucca let you take them.” With eyes now closed, the patient took a bite, as if the momentary absence of one sense could heighten another.</p>

<p>“Was a gift from our friend Waldek. Our little secret! OH you’re going to love this place Lew! It’s abundant with greens and oranges and purples and—”</p>

<p>Yesterday Lupin had been too sick to really take in the details of the oasis, but now beyond the fragrant poetry of the mapple toast, this nose detected hints of sweet norcorn and teaweet in the air. These smells summoned an approximation of what the oasis looked like in Lupin’s brain.</p>

<p>“—and blues!”</p>

<p>“Looking forward to seeing that,” Lupin said with a smile, before taking note of the poultice. “Thanks for taking care of me.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Sure! Zucca made that poultice for you though, that’s what healed you up.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well I'll thank Zucca too then.”</p>

<p>“You’d better! Medililly takes ages to grow, was kind of our host to spare some,” Eka said.</p>

<p>After their meal they removed the poultice and checked the wound, the inflammation was down. Hush walked around the tent, cheeks full of food. A stomach full of fresh, colorful food may have played a part in the hyroo's quick recovery.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lupin was playing a game with Eka to pass the time, one called 'name that spice'. They had jars covered with cloths, and each person had to smell and guess the spice aloud. Whoever got the most right won the game. Lupin picked up a jar and smelled it through the cloth, "hm. Rosemeric? I think?" And passed it to Eka, "thymin."</p>

<p>Lupin frowned, jotting down their guesses, "no way that's thymin."</p>

<p>Eka smirked, picking up another jar to smell. "Popmeg."</p>

<p>Lupin took the jar in turn, and frowned. "Popmeg, yea right. It's dilly."</p>

<p>"You know, it's okay to make the same guess as me." Eka said, grabbing the last jar to smell it. "Dilly."</p>

<p>Lupin was going to start complaining about how unfair the game was, but then they heard Zucca yelling outside. They peered out through the opening of their tent, spotting the Terin chasing pale winged insects out of a plumpkin field.</p>

<p>Eka wandered out of the tent. “Whats going on? Oh! You have mosslings in your produce!”</p>

<p>“Can’t get rid of em’. They hate lemoni grass so I planted some around to keep them away, but I’m beginning to think they’ve developed a taste for it. Curse these things! They make everything rot.” Zucca said, discouraged and tired from chasing after them.</p>

<p>Lupin had stayed near the tent, sipping tea, at peace and content despite the ever-present chest pains. The oasis had a voice all its own, speaking through the rustling of the various plants in the field. A concerto of greenery. There were not many around to listen, a handful of hounds, the caretaker, Eka. Lupin noticed that there wasn’t anyone else here, and that this orchestra sang for too few. Zucca and the hounds were producing all of this food for themselves, with no one else around to feed, that is unless there was a village of tiny people over there in that walled garden by the house. Lupin tried to bring up the topic later that day, when tasked with peeling bams for tonight’s dinner. Eka too, thought it strange.</p>

<p>“Let’s ask the vegetables!” Eka set the peeled bams down in a pot and wandered over to the fields. Red stopped where Zucca had been earlier that day, to the mossling-infested field, kneeling down to talk to a rotting karrot head. “What’s the deal with this Zucca fellow anyway?”</p>

<p>Lupin watched from afar. “Stop it. You do not speak vegetable.”</p>

<p>Eka replied with a quick "Shush!" Loud voices could incite the ill-tempered landlord to come back over here again with that rake. Eka layed an ear against the side of the karrot, listening for an answer, “oh! A secret you say?”</p>

<p>Lupin watched, resisting the urge to ask about what the karrot was saying. Asking would mean giving into this prank, but then again Eka knew a lot about the world, perhaps there was such a thing as vegetable tongue, a language that could not be spoken with words, but with light, or vibrations. After a short conversation, Eka rose and wandered back over to Lupin. There was some silence, but it did not last. “What did it say?” Lupin asked.</p>

<p>“It said that there is something valuable here,” saying this, Eka covered these ruby eyes with two hands and uncovered them just as quickly, “hidden away!”</p>

<p>That got the Verido’s attention, “valuable? You mean like a treasure?”</p>

<p>“Like a secret,” Eka corrected, pressing the point of a finger hard on Lupin’s nose. Red sat down again, continuing to peel some bams for tonight’s dinner of bam soup with slices of muckwheat bread.</p>

<p>The thought of a secret was intriguing, but likely false. Even so, Lupin could not sleep that night, haunted by the idea of a treasure, drawn by mystery and the unknown. If Zucca had a secret it would be somewhere near the house, that whole area looked very sheltered and private.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day, feeling much better, Lupin got up before the sun. Zucca was awake too, standing in the fields, tending to the crops and far too busy to notice anyone else was awake Lupin knew better than to break into someone’s home, and instead decided to circle it, hopefully this would satiate the Verido’s curiosity. Lupin arrived on the eastern face of the house, but a tall green hedge blocked the way and there was no break in the branches, no way to see through the thickness. Lupin put an arm in it, to see if it was as thick as it looked, reaching deep until the branches met with the shoulder and torso. "Um, thick indeed." Lupin said. The Verido suddenly saw Waldek there, standing close.</p>

<p>“Hey Waldek! We’re friends right? You’re not going to tell on me are you?” Lupin said in a hushed voice, stuck halfway into the hedge, scarf and hair caught into the branches.</p>

<p>Waldek let out quiet bark, and then another.</p>

<p>"No no no shush, shush!" Lupin begged. Getting out of the mass of shrubbery was harder than getting in, its branches curled inwards and refused to let go. "I can't get out!"</p>

<p>Waldek caught the scent of food the air, from Eka making breakfast and ran off, leaving Lupin alone again, trapped in the hedge. "Oh good, oh good..." Lupin tried to wriggle out, but the only way out of this would be to break branches, and then Zucca would know someone had been here. Going inside, following the curve of the branches was the best option. With a grunt and an ow, the Verido popped out of the other side, clothes full of leaves, and skin full of light scratches. The hedge now had a Lupin-shaped hole, a weird, not-quite triangular outline that made the hedge look like it was in mid-cry. This supposed inoffensive excursion around Zucca’s house had turned into a full out break-in. “The branches of the shrub and its curly fingers made me do it,” was hardly an excuse. Lupin could not accuse the karrot either, blaming the words of a vegetable would do no one any good. If the root vegetable could speak, its mossling-infected mind would also be susceptible to telling untruths.</p>

<p>“What am I doing.” The Verido took a step back, but another orange leafhound began to bark and growl from inside the compound. Lupin kept as far away from the hound as the hedge permitted, fitting back in the Verido-shaped hole, and in this instant, Lupin saw what the hedge was concealing. A vast green field full of young sproutlings. The reason the hound was so miffed, was because Lupin had almost crushed one.</p>

<p>“Oh hey I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>The hound’s antennae ears caressed the near-crushed plant gently, all was well, its protector was content. Although it did not approve of the intruder’s proximity, and with a push of the nose, the leafhound nudged Lupin away from the field. This place was full of fragile sproutlings, rows of little green nubs pushing out of the soil. Some had leaves that had different shapes, and colors.</p>

<p>"This is a nursery." Lupin said, amazed.</p>

<p>Lupin had seen nurseries before, they had a small one in Volare, but at most the village had two growing at once, this place had many more. A nursery this size explained the need for a large and reliable food source. Zucca had planted enough sprouts here to populate a small city. After circling the field, under the watchful eye of the hound, Lupin moved closer to the house to look at a calendar on a wall, marked with possible harvesting dates. There were bags of grains, as well as a giant bowl made of rock with a large yukwood mallet. This is where Zucca ground-up the food, made small for tiny mouths to chew. Lupin ran a hand along the insides of the bowl, and tasted some remnants of the ground-up grain in it. “Granulated teaweet berries,” teaweet was a widely consumed grain, but this teaweet was different, it had a strong aroma and tasted sweet, clean and fresh.</p>

<p>In Volare, the grain was bland and had to be augmented with spices. Adding spices to something as perfect as these grains would be criminal. Lost in thought, Lupin had only just noticed a figure moving inside the house. It was time to leave. The Verido hurried back towards the bushes. Precipitated by the fear of being discovered, Lupin kicked dirt over footprints and threw the broken branches back into the hedge. There was no time to make peace with the hedge itself, Lupin pushed through the dense thicket and emerged on the other side. The Verido then hurried back to camp, to tell Eka of this discovery.</p>

<hr />

<p>“You do realize I was making fun of you last night. Zucca does have a secret though, that much is clear,” Eka said.</p>

<p>Lupin didn’t care about that. “There’s a nursery in there! Full of tiny people like we said! A nursery encircled by hedges. There's tons of grains, and rows and rows of sprouts!" the Verido paused then, “think Zucca’s raising an army?”</p>

<p>Eka laughed at this, “definitely. They’ll be carving swords from karrots, and helmets from hollowed-out kappages. A veil of teaweet arrows will blot out the sun!”</p>

<p>Just then, they heard barking outside. The hounds were likely chasing away another floater, but then they heard new voices followed by Zucca's classic line: “Get off my land!”</p>

<p>Lupin and Eka poked their heads out of the tent to look at the scene outside, Zucca was at the edge of the oasis with a collection of leafhounds, barring entry to a vennec-pulled wagon and 3 travelers.</p>

<p>“You need to leave!” Zucca screamed at them.</p>

<p>One of the travelers grabbed an empty sac of grains from the wagon to show that they were in dire need of supplies.</p>
<p>“Travelers,” Lupin whispered to Eka.</p>

<p>Zucca yelled for them to leave. “You have 10 seconds to leave this place! There will be consequences if you don't!”</p>

<p>Another traveler, depleted of energy, could not stand for this. “You'd prefer we die then?”</p>

<p>Once their time was up, Zucca reached into a side pouch and pulled out a handful of green herbs, tossing it at them. The hounds pulled away, just as the floaters came rushing in, attracted by the scent. The red spherical parasites chased after the intruders.</p>

<p>Lupin watched, cringing as multiple floaters latched onto the skin of the smallest of the group, while the others tried to get them off their friend. The victim fell on the ground, screaming. Lupin’s heart ached, something had to be done. The Verido turned to Eka, but the red head was already gone.</p>

<p>Eka was riding Hush and grabbed the collar of the injured traveler. Together, they jumped up high into the sky, like they’d done before to get rid of the floaters. Altitude and cold, two things they knew worked against them. The other two travelers boarded their wagon and ran away, urging their vennec forward.</p>

<p>Zucca did not fail to see that Eka had helped them, and the farmer's angry eyes moved to judge Lupin next. “You’re with them aren’t you? They sent you ahead didn’t they? I trusted you!” The leafhounds stayed at the edge of the oasis while Zucca moved toward Lupin. Once there, Zucca flipped the rake around to show another more pointy, more dangerous end, aiming it at the Verido’s throat.</p>

<p>Lupin did not move. “You CAN trust me Zucca!”</p>

<p>“Then why’s your friend helping them?” Zucca spat, pressing the point against Lupin's soft skin.</p>

<p>“Because Eka is kind.”</p>

<p>Zucca must have known the Verido wasn’t lying, because those lips found no suitable rebuttal. “What about you? Are you kind Lew-pee-lew?”</p>

<p>Eka liked to give people ridiculous nicknames, but this jest was ill-timed. This situation was delicate, a laugh would be most unwelcome and most unwise with a stick at your throat. “I like to think I am, yes. And if you don’t mind. I’d rather you call me Lupin. Only my mapa calls me Lew-pee-lew.”</p>

<p>Zucca’s face was warped with rage. “I bet you like to think that you’re a truth-sayer too? You were in my nursery today, don’t deny it I know you were there! What did you see? You stole from me didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Lupin knew it was dumb to think that their host wouldn’t find out about that visit to the nursery earlier, only a person without sight could have missed that large hole in the hedge. “I'm sorry. I did go, but I took nothing.”</p>

<p>“Im sick of this! Of people like you, coming in here, feigning kindness to steal from me!”</p>

<p>Lupin was afraid of what Zucca would do in this heightened state. But then Eka landed back in the oasis with Hush, and the injured traveler. “Why did you bring that filth back in here?!” Zucca’s voice was becoming shrill with fury.</p>

<p>“We need to care for these wounds,” Eka said, speaking low and slow, carrying the injured traveler.</p>

<p>Speaking in a tranquil manner did not help to suppress Zucca’s growing resentment. “I made a mistake letting you come in here." Zucca's hand dove into the side pouch again. Lupin remembered this from before, that pouch was full of herbs, something the floaters could not resist, just a few blades of green in the air and these things would come rushing!</p>

<p>Before Zucca could do it, Lupin grabbed the Terin’s arm. “Don’t do it! Please.”</p>

<p>Eka stepped in as well, a hand set on the pouch of herbs. “That’s sweet grass-” the red head said, catching the scent of it, “the floaters like sweet grass.”</p>

<p>Zucca couldn’t push Eka away, those ruby eyes had a soothing quality to them. “Y-yes. It is.” Both learned then that the valley around the oasis was full of patches of sweet grass, planted there with purpose, to attract the floaters and to keep people away, but the creatures ate it up too fast, and the keeper of the oasis always had to plant more. Because they now had a dependable source of food, the floaters became greedy, and even more territorial. Zucca had gone through a lot of trouble to keep this place hidden.</p>

<p>The injured traveler could not believe that the Terin was responsible for these floaters being here. “You’ve been feeding those things? You know how many of us they’ve hurt?”</p>

<p>“You think I don’t know?!” Zucca’s voice adopted a deep, menacing tone. The caretaker looked tired of fighting and arguing. “I take no pleasure in hurting others, I really don’t. I just don’t have the energy to keep intruders away on my own, I don’t have many hounds left anymore...” Saying this, Zucca's appeared sad. Zucca loved the leafhounds like children, Eka could tell.</p>

<p>They convinced their host to let them heal Laris, the traveler, and that they would keep watch. It was uncharacteristic of the Terin to trust strangers like this, to allow them to tend to yet another stranger, but Eka inspired confidence. Round ears. People with round ears, according to this Terin, were not known to lie.</p>

<hr />

<p>That night, from their camp in the oasis, they could see that the vennec-pulled wagon was still out there. A fire danced in the distance, signalling their presence. Eka had sent the woth over, to instruct the other travelers to stay close, and to make no attempt to come to the oasis. Red also promised that Laris would be cared for, and returned to them the next day. The woth returned to the oasis to inform them that the message had been delivered, “thank you crumpet,” but alas, the woth did not answer to that name and went to rest inside of its glass house. Zucca, Lupin, Eka and the patient were in the tent. The Terin decided not to rest until all strangers in the oasis had gone away. Eka made poultices, having learned Zucca's recipe just by smell alone, and made the medicine using herbs that Waldek had once again, secretly provided. Of course, none of this was lost on Zucca. The farmer eyed the poultice with angry, suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>“All they want is food. Surely you can spare some?” Lupin asked.</p>

<p>Zucca was busy filling a pipe with dried and crushed bonan leaves, after lighting it the Terin took a few puffs, the whole tent was soon filled with the smell of bonan. “They never just want food.”</p>

<p>The Verido looked puzzled, “how do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Land, food, and seeds.”</p>

<p>“The children...” Lupin said in a low voice, but Zucca had seen the word on the Verido's lips.</p>

<p>“What made you trespass into my home Lupin?”</p>

<p>“You have so much produce, more than enough to feed yourself and those hounds for years. I just wanted to understand. Besides, you can’t know that people will want more, the travelers just wanted a bit of help.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, I can’t know. So i prefer to assume that they’re false, it’s safer for me and the children. I’ve had too many deceivers here, too many to count.” Zucca sucked at the pipe, smoke pushing out of these nostrils.</p>

<p>Eka looked at Zucca, “there are so few of you left.”</p>

<p>The Terin took another long puff from the pipe, before exhaling again. “We have the Iridi to thank for that.”</p>

<p>"I don't know the story." Lupin admitted.</p>

<p>Zucca sighed, yellow smoke coming out of the nose. "The Iridi were obssessed with chloromyce shroos, but it was a hard, hard job to harvest them. You had to spend days in the dark, digging through walls. They didn't want their own people to suffer so they began to capture workers from neighboring cities to do the work instead. One of their first targets was Ministe, where I lived at the time. The city was quickly overrun with soldiers. Many escaped, but most were not prepared for the challenges of nomadic-living, and the shock of losing their home resulted in many suffering from bouts of listless depression. The Terin workforce was severely reduced, leaving very few to continue to work the earth. The few Terin villages left standing became overcrowded. People were forbidden from planting their young, but it was just as well because malnutrition was rampant, and not many could produce healthy seeds." Zucca paused to refill the pipe with fresh bonan leaves.</p>

<p>"By then the Iridi had a steady flow of chloromyce shroos, but Moera was greedy, and tired of dealing with Terin workers. My people work hard, but we're stubborn. Moera decided that they would have to grow their own workers instead, only then, would they be fully submissive. By then, myself along with a handful of other Terins built the Suvalba Sanctuary, where a parent could come and sow their young in a protected environment. It was a secret location, and it worked well for many years... but then a group of Iridi soldiers got word of it. They raided the sanctuary and took all of the unsown seeds, and detroyed the rest. I escaped with a collection of seeds, and some of the resident leafhounds. Losing the sanctuary was hard on me. The parents had trusted us with their young. We weren’t soldiers, we couldn't fight the attackers, well, not unless we had a death wish. I suspected that another Terin had leaked the information, many turned to vice after the fall of our home land." It appeared that Zucca knew exactly who had done it, but thinking about the person was too painful.</p>

<p>"Alone, I searched for a place to start fresh, somewhere far and hidden. While on the outskirs of Montore, I met two strangers in the desert who told me about a place that was still invisible to the world and that could host such a project. Depleted of strength and energy, and desperate, I followed their instructions. I found the place. It was perfect. There was a great recess in the land, surrounded by large irinwood trees, and rows of fragglebush on the ground. This was no mirage. It was a miraculous remnant of the old world. The trees and shrubs would protect the new sanctuary from sand dunes shifting in high winds and from the eyes of curious onlookers. In the hollow I found a boundless waterstone pit. Waterstone pits this size were rare. The stranger must have known about it. It was too, too perfect. But there was nothing else growing there at the time, getting it to the state it is now took a long time, and lot of work."</p>

<p>"I'm glad they never found this place," Lupin said, relieved.</p>

<p>"The Iridi might have expanded much further, if it hadn’t been for the loss of Moera. No one knows what happened, but it was enough to stop the armies from advancing further. The next leader, Bao, put a stop to it, with an endless supply of workers they stopped the raids and closed their city to the world," Zucca stared at the tent wall, but these eyes had pierced the fabric, parted the row of irinwood trees, shifted the sand dunes and split whole mountains, to better watch Irideri, to make sure that the Iridi city was still closed. "May those brutes never leave the Andenuis again..."</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day Zucca allowed Eka and Lupin to view the nursery, while Hush and the hounds had been left in charge of the patient in the tent. Everyone on this dust ball was born from the earth, from seeds. A willing, and healthy parent could sow a seed, and eventually the seed would grow into a sprout. This could take a long time, depending on the state of the soil and temperature. Some races could only sprout in the dark, others in high-moisture environments, even altitude played a part in the growing process. At harvest, a carer would help each child out of the ground, severing their roots. The children needed protection and good nutrition to thrive. The leaves on their heads would fall in time, and like the roots, they left no mark behind. The young grew fast, and even faster in good conditions.</p>

<p>Zucca pointed to the markings on Lupin’s face, “those lines you wear are a remnant of when everyone lived in the wilds. The Verido didn’t have color on their faces then. The color segregation of your people is unfortunate Lupin, I rather liked the subtleties of the patterns from before, like veins on a leaf. Colors are so, so vulgar.”</p>

<p>Lupin wasn’t sure what to say, looking at the patterns on these arms in silent embarrassment. The Verido recalled when these patterns were colored blue, it was a painful process. The people of Volare were proud of the color, it was a tribute to Vol, their carrier and protector. The festivities around this event were extravagant, everyone in the city was there and prepared food and activities, baking looma root pies, organizing glider races and whistling contests. For Lupin, the party was even more grandiose given their relation to Volare. Now, thinking of it, perhaps these colors did serve to separate their people. No other race in the desert did this.</p>

<p>Eka put a hand on Lupin’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze. “It looks nice blue,” saying this, before ruffling up the Verido's pale head of hair, dispelling all feelings of unnecessary shamefaced-ness.</p>

<p>Zucca went on to explain that bearing seeds was a complicated matter, anyone could start bearing seeds after a certain age. Though not all would sprout into children, the ones that didn't were ground-up into fodder for other seeds for nourishment. Events of the world made seed-bearing difficult. A hungry and tired person would produce nothing at all. Greenery too was a rarity, and it was the same for safe planting grounds. Many stopped sowing. For the better part of history, Terins were responsible for the steady, and healthy growth of children. This dependence on outside help was the main cause for the world’s growing depopulation problem. Levi had spoken of a Terin living in Volare, that cared for the seeds, but this was long ago. Growing up, the Verido had no memory of a Terin living amongst them. This raised many questions, had the elders done away with this practice?</p>

<p>“Have you ever planted one of yours?” Lupin asked Zucca.</p>

<p>“I owe it to all of the parents who entrusted us with their young to finish the work we started in the Suvalba Sanctuary. Planting my own? That would be selfish. These seedlings are my responsibility, their needs and safety are above my own. Rather die than to fail them in this.” The farmer replied.</p>

<p>Conversations with Zucca always seemed to take a dark turn, it would always end with Lupin feeling terrible.</p>

<p>Eka had wandered to another part of the nursery, accompanied by Waldek who was excited to show how big the sprouts in the northern end of the field had become. Eka’s presence usually helped to keep dark thoughts a good distance away, now thoughts of Volare, of Levi, of being Voice, all of it was re-surfacing in this Verido’s mind.</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t really want to sow seeds either.” Lupin said to Zucca, eyes on a sprout, part of a row reserved for Aodal children. “My reasons are selfish. I’ve always had pressure to do it. Because of my connection with the Ilk and to Volare... it was always expected of me. I would have to sow a seed, to raise another Voice. It’s kind of a big deal. Now that I’ve gone, my branch of the family has ended. I feel bad to say it, but I’m sort of, you know… relieved.” Although, shortly after saying it, Lupin realized that maybe this wasn’t even the real reason. This Verido had a bad habit of thinking out loud.</p>

<p>“Don’t dwell on it. It’s for the best. You would make a terrible Mapa,” Zucca admitted, looking at the leaves of a nearby sprout.</p>

<p>Lupin laughed at this. Zucca’s honesty was brutal at times, but correct in this case. “Yea. Maybe.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Lupin returned to the tent in the afternoon, to check on their patient. Laris was awake, though weak still. “You live here?” Laris asked.</p>

<p>“Just passing through.”</p>

<p>“You should help us!” The patient sat up, despite the wounds being fresh. A pair of thin hands shot forward and grabbed onto Lupin’s. Laris said it again, but with more confidence this time, “you will help us.” It was more of a demand then a suggestion.</p>

<p>“To do what exactly?” Lupin wanted to look away, but couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>“We’re starving, we need supplies if we hope to make it back to Kippu.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we can convince Zucca to part with a few items...”</p>

<p>“That would be wonderful.” Laris began to relax, releasing the Verido and melting back into the bed. “So you’ve been here a while then? You’ve seen the nursery?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?” Lupin replied, unsure if it was a good idea to speak about this.</p>

<p>Children are such a rarity these days, I’m of bearing age but it just isn’t working out you know? It’s probably for the best, I can barely feed myself. It doesn’t matter. Don’t you think it cruel to create more life in such times?”</p>

<p>Lupin knew why Laris couldn’t bear seeds, it was probably due to some deficiencies. “Ill have a talk with Zucca. I promise.”</p>

<p>“What about you, would you bear seeds… I mean, if you could?” Laris asked.</p>

<p>“No.” Lupin replied, but was shocked with how quickly this was said. The Verido tried to sit with this question and its answer for a little while before speaking, to not suffer a repeat of the conversation with Zucca again. “I mean, I don’t know really. It’s a big decision. I feel like I don’t know anything about anything. One of my good friends told me once that I was always underperforming, so afraid of failing to achieve great things that I continued to fail. I lack confidence… in a lot that I do, and I’m wondering if my ‘not wanting to bear a seed’ is just another fear I have, of failing at doing something important. Another self-fulfilling prophecy. This habit makes it hard to figure out what I really want… but then again, maybe I’ll never know what I want and I just need to commit to something and work at it. It’s all it is isn’t it? Committing to something, and putting in the work?” Lupin noticed then that Laris had drifted off to sleep. “Rest well” The Verido said, smiling, relieved that this little speech had had no spectators.</p>

<p>Lupin felt terrible, and decided on going to speak with Zucca again, despite knowing that their conversation would only worsen those feelings. This time Lupin used the front gate rather than the bushes to go inside.</p>

<p>The Terin was in the nursery feeding the seedlings, crushing wet stones over each one. The stones lay folded into an apron. It was a lot of weight to carry, but this worker did not shy away from laborious tasks, especially if small lives depended on it.</p>

<p>“Can’t you give them supplies?” Lupin regretted the abruptness of the question, but didn’t know how else to ask.</p>

<p>Zucca continued to work. “What did the vagabond tell you hm?”</p>

<p>It would be difficult to rid Zucca of this bias, but this didn’t deter Lupin. “The same thing they told you. They’re hungry.”</p>

<p>“And like I told all of you, this is about more than food.”</p>

<p>Lupin wished for a way to communicate these thoughts better, “you can’t be sure of that! You may very well kill them if you don’t help. This is what I know.”</p>

<p>“Dying, yes. That may be true, but that’s only because they spend all their time begging for food. They should try gardening instead of living off of others like parasites.”</p>

<p>“I thought you cared about all life,” Lupin said, sourly.</p>

<p>“I do!” Zucca replied, irritated by all of these accusations. “I’ll give them food and they’ll ask to stay the night, then they’ll ask to see the nursery. The nursery makes people lose their minds. Many feel that the world has too many unfed mouths. Mouths. What of minds? No one wants to learn, and even fewer can name all of the plants that grow where they live. When people don’t care then it is easy to disrupt and destroy without thought. Yes, I could teach the young ones how to provide for themselves, how to sow and care for food. I could do that, but I can’t teach adults. Everyone wants to live in a field but no one wants to break their backs working the soil, that’s a fact. They want the comforts and conveniences of a city while people like me do all of the grubby work. That’s all anyone ever cares about.” Zucca’s hands were gripping so hard at those waterstones that clear liquid was seeping out of the hard skins, from tiny cracks zigzagging on the sides. “I’ve seen it happen enough times to know. I may not look it but I have many years on me Lupin. The world has not turned me bitter, I’m quite happy, but I can’t abide lethargy.” It’s true that the Terin did not look old, though those hands showed age and wear.</p>

<p>Lupin swallowed hard, Zucca was making a whole lot of assumptions about people, it wasn't fair. “Deficiencies and fear will do that to a person! You need to help them! You said it yourself, you’ll teach the children to care for themselves, why not teach travelers? Why keep those skills to yourself? If they don’t know why it’s important because no one was there to teach them then it’s not really their fault! You can make a difference.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do? Take care of a farm AND a school for inept gardeners? I’ve no time for it. Grown adults do not change their ways, they just don’t. They always have hidden motives. They come to steal, to buy too, and then there’s these rotten entrepreneurial types that show up here... they are rotten to the core and will always put status and profit before care and wellness. It is wrong, and backward, and I won’t give them any more of my precious time.” With this, Lupin was ordered away. This conversation was tiring, but soon the strangers would leave and take their questions and unpleasantries along with them. At least the hounds couldn’t talk, and only yapped to report a problem. “You will leave with that vagrant tomorrow. I’ll deal with my own problems. I always have.”</p>

<p>“You’ve created all of these possibilities of things that could but may never happen. And you know not everyone is like this! It’s unfair. I’m sure you can all live here together happily. You’ll need help to raise all those children, just give them a chance,” Lupin insisted, in a near-begging tone.</p>

<p>Zucca eyes darkened then, lines formed in places where there had been none previously, like that mask of youth had suddenly cracked all the way off. “I have no need of help. No need of it you hear?!” With this, the Terin disappeared inside the house and slammed the door to a close.</p>

<p>Lupin returned to the tent and retold Eka everything that had happened, the conversation with Laris and the one with Zucca. All of it recounted in a voice most sombre. That conversation had been the death of hope. The Verido wanted to help everyone but this was not possible. Sitting near the Wonder offered no comfort today, Eka was running fingers over Laris’s face, even in sleep, the traveler looked worn-out, spent. Lupin too, had a face fit for wear at a Leaping Day. Eka threw an arm around the shoulder of this downhearted companion, and squeezed it tightly.</p>

<p>“Zucca wants us to leave,” Lupin said, hurt by the Terin’s indifference. Even Eka’s presence did little to assuage this pain.</p>

<p>“Then, we will do as our host wants, we can’t force anyone’s hand.” Eka replied. “You know, back in the old days, Terins used to do check-ups on the Ilk. They did this during their yearly stops, back when Ministe was still standing. The Voices would report to the Terins on the year, on the pains the Ilk may have mentioned. When Ministe fell, a Terin, Melanza, boarded the Ilk of Volare and taught your people how to care for Vol. Melanza helped to create the Hands, as you know them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember that. Maliss learned a lot from Melanza, especially for the nursery. We had population problems then, but not since.”</p>

<p>Eka nodded. “Terins can see sickness and health in others, its second nature. They’re the carers of the world.”</p>

<p>Lupin swallowed hard then. “When the carers are near-extinct, as they are now… what does that say of the state of the world?”</p>

<p>“Get some rest Lew.” Eka said with a smile, “It’s late.”</p>

<p>All went to sleep, all, but Laris who had overheard their conversation. In the night, the patient left the sick bed and marched over to the house atop the hill. The strong scent of those poultices covered up all smells and so the hounds did not sense the stranger walking about, besides, all were tired after today’s events. Laris pushed through the hedge, like Lupin had done, and arrived on the other side. Just ahead, slept row after row of sprouts with green tops sticking out of the dirt. They looked beautiful there, lighted by the moonlights, casting the tiniest of shadows. To Laris, this field was not a bringer of joy, but a thing of cruelty. This body had suffered much, with skin spread thin over a hollow  skeleton, it never had the chance to thicken to better protect the fragile organs inside. Laris feared that these beautiful sprouts too would suffer the same fate, that this land would not keep its promise and would not stay green. Panicked, Laris's hands dove into the dirt, fingers wrapping tightly around the stem of a sprout. “You won't suffer like I did, I wont allow it,” Laris said, getting ready to pull.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some later hours, Zucca awoke to tend to the usual morning chores. Walking into the nursery, the Terin froze, Laris was sitting in the nursery, hands full of dirt and head hanging low.</p>

<p>“Wh-why are you here.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence, but eventually, Laris spoke up. “I wanted to rip out every single one. To spare them of all misery, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>Zucca stepped forward and frantically began to look around to make sure that all of the sprouts were safe. Laris had done nothing, but the mere presence of another in this place was scary still. Nurseries were delicate, and reacted strongly to their environment. Under stress, children could grow up to be anxious, and if they suffered harm whilst still in the ground they could have deformities. Though despite Laris being here, none of them looked stressed, as if they knew that they would not be harmed. The Terin was relieved, and could resume breathing again. Zucca grabbed hold of the intruder’s arm, but the fingers noticed a strange texture under them. Right there, on Laris’ arm, was a foodstamp.</p>

<p>Zucca looked at Laris. “You’ve been living off of this crap?”</p>

<p>Upon close inspection, there were other foodstamps decorating this stranger’s skin, all expired, all sucked dry of their nutrients. The Terin sighed and took a seat down in the mud, in-between rows of greening leaves, and began to peel the stamps off one by one. Like a leafhound searching for parasites on a plant, Zucca’s fingers searched around for stamps, “no one ever tell you you can’t live off stamps? What a ridiculous invention, these are no substitute for real food.” The Terin was gentle, even if the face betrayed other emotions. The sprouts really could sense anger in a voice, the gentle carer did not wish to trouble them with this, and kept calm.</p>

<p>This tranquility surprised Laris, and despite being handled by gentle caring hands these limbs could not stop trembling. “Everyone in Montore uses these.”</p>

<p>“These,” Zucca began, removing, yet another stamp “are expired. They provide some nutrition when fresh but not like this.”</p>

<p>Laris’s eyes threatened to leak all of their water, “the crew of a passing Beobug sandfin sold us a crate-full.”</p>

<p>During yesterday’s events, blind with rage, Zucca had failed to notice how thin Laris was, with arms that weren't the same length. One was visibly shorter, and even the ears bore this same kind of unevenness. Zucca deduced that someone had likely stepped over Laris as a sprout, resulting in these deformities. Not everyone was lucky enough to be born in a sheltered place like the oasis nursery. Zucca was sad. Way back when, keeping sprouts healthy and safe was all a Terin needed to be happy. It was easy to forget that everyone was a sprout once, small and frail. The errors of others had turned Zucca into a terrible grouch, and now these hands had almost hurt an innocent.</p>

<p>Zucca decided to sit on those feelings. There was no room for weak creatures in this world. The farmer accompanied Laris out of the compound. They walked through the fields together. As they walked, Laris glanced at the endless supply of produce, but did not ask for any, but did mention something this: “You have false-mosslings in your produce.”</p>

<p>“What are you are talking about,” Zucca said, hurrying ahead, wishing Laris would stop talking. This little walk was painful enough.</p>

<p>“False-mosslings. They mimic mosslings. They have curly antennae, and are impervious to lemoni grass. They hate mepperpint. Read it in a book once.”</p>

<p>At these words, Zucca froze in mid-step, but then shrugged it off. Both continued to walk in silence, to the encampment where the others travelers were. Two hounds had come along, to ensure their master’s safety. They arrived at the wagon. The vennec raised its head and peered at the strangers, body shaking, nervous at the sight of the hounds. The two travelers heard the voice of their friend, and moved out of the wagon to greet Laris. Both were happy to see that their friend was safe, avoiding Zucca's eyes. Like Laris, the two had uneven limbs, and the thinness of their skin was alarming, see-through and fragile. Zucca was embarrassed to stand there with a fleshy body. The travelers helped Laris onto the wagon, and urged the vennec onward. Zucca wanted to say something, but couldn't manage it. With words unsaid, the caretaker went back into the oasis with the leafhounds.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eka and Lupin were awake, both were afraid for Laris when they’d noticed the bed was empty, but then they saw the group leaving in the distance. They kept their promise to Zucca, and were now pulling the tent apart and packing away their gear. They did not address their host, not out of fear, but because of the Terin’s evident sadness. Zucca walked to a field of herbs, and picked out a handful of fresh meppermint, then went over to the mossling-infested fields and distributed some around. A sprig of it lay atop a plumpkin that had long been plagued by these pesky insects. Zucca waited for a moment, nothing changed. With a sigh, the Terin walked off but then noticed a mossling flying past, and then another. All had curly antennae. Laris was right. The pests began to fly off in droves. Zucca laughed, a sound most curious coming from such a grouch. “False-mosslings. How elegant.”</p>

<p>Eka saw the insects flying away, looking for another place to nest, and smiled. “You did it! Mosslings are leaving!” Saying it loud enough so Zucca would hear.</p>

<p>“False-mosslings,” Zucca corrected. “I thought the world had nothing more to teach me. Not everyone is equipped with the knowledge to save themselves... I mistook this for lethargy. I let some wicked few corrupt my view of others.” Terins were supposed to care for others, not just in the sprouting phase, but throughout their lives too. People never really stopped growing. “I’ve made a huge mistake.”</p>


<p>Eka held a hand out. “Not yet you haven’t.”</p>

<p>Zucca and Eka climbed onto Hush, ready to go intercept the travelers aboard their wagon. Before leaving, the Terin looked at Waldek. “You’re in charge. You are the wisest one here. And as for you Lupin,” the Terin smiled at the Verido. A first. “Don’t. Touch. Anything.”</p>

<p>Lupin laughed, and did as told.</p>

<p>Hush and its passengers disappeared into the distance, and later returned, leading the wagon back into the oasis. Zucca did not apologize, but did fill their bellies with fresh foods. The meal transformed their faces completely. The 3 looked different somehow, less translucent, solid and content. The Terin decided to teach the travelers to grow food, in exchange for help around the fields. They would be fed and housed, for a year to start. It was difficult for this grouch to commit to longer than this, the Terin did not trust others yet, but one year seemed reasonable and after that time perhaps they’d be granted an extension, or better yet, permanent residence. The travelers accepted. Laris, most of all. They had no ties to any city.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day, Eka and Lupin filled their bags with fresh produce, with Zucca's permission. They stood over a mapple bush, picking the fruits by hand. Lupin grabbed hold of an oversized mapple, its ribbed skin glistening under the suns. The Verido peeled off part of the outer layer and took a big bite. “This doesn’t taste anything like that other mapple I had, it’s so bitter,” Lupin said, nose wrinkling, resisting the urge to spit out the piece of precious fruit in front of Zucca “it's so bitter it hurts my face.”</p>

<p>“You really know nothing of the world,” Zucca said, reaching into the mapple bush and picking out another fruit. Zucca smelled the fruit, then scratched lightly at its skin and smelled it again before handing it over to Lupin “you’ll like this one. Finish that other one first though, I don’t tolerate waste in my garden.”</p>

<p>Lupin was going to whine aloud but decided against it.</p>

<p>“You’re also a carer aren’t you? Do you think that making green places and growing sprouts really matters? On a grand scale I mean, say, you were flying over the planet, or if your head reached above the clouds.” Zucca asked Eka suddenly.</p>

<p>Eka had a mouth full of mapple and couldn’t answer right away, but Zucca decided that this is something that would be better left unasked. Instead the farmer asked this: “What is your favorite food?” Hopefully that wouldn’t count as two questions.</p>

<p>Eka swallowed the bits of mapple, smiling. “I like noranges a lot, bit rare though.”</p>

<p>The Terin disappeared inside the house, and returned with a small pouch of fabric. Inside the fabric pouch was a seed. “Plant this seed in a green place, in a few years you’ll get some noranges.” Zucca explained that this seed had been salvaged from the Iridi raids at the Suvalba Sanctuary. Their host also gave them two fresh noranges from the only tree on the property, as thanks.</p>
<p>Lupin thought about the mossling-infected karrot then, and of the treasure of the oasis. Eka knew there was something important here and chose to communicate it by way of a terrible joke involving a rotten vegetable. The nursery, while important, was the secret, but a being who can create life in the desert, now that was a true treasure.</p>

<p>“It will be planted in the greenest of places, I promise,” Eka said, before eyeing Waldek the leafhound who sat there, at their feet, tail waggling. “Keep your master safe okay?”</p>

<p>Waldek barked, before turning to Lupin, its antennae prodding Lupin’s legs and chest. It let out a whine then, but Zucca stepped in. “Don’t you have work to do?” The hound barked again, and moved off into the fields with the others. Then, the Terin handed a bag of medililly herbs to Lupin. “Brew a leaf with your tea, a leaf a day,” Zucca paused then, a thick hand coming to rest on the Verido’s shoulder, “make it part of your routine. A leaf a day. Easy to remember. You’ve got enough here for a long while, but come back and see me when you run out… well, before you run out.”</p>

<p>Lupin accepted the gift, acknowledging how precious the leaves were. "A leaf a day, got it". Eka had said that medililly was hard to grow. "Thanks Zucca.”</p>

<p>The two left shortly after the afternoon of vegetable and fruit picking, their bags plump with fresh supplies. They wished Laris and the travelers well, and thanked the leafhounds, and the farmer. Zucca watched as the two, led by Hush, disappeared behind the row of canopied trees.</p>
