<h2>— Chapter 9 —</h2>

<img src="../media/content/fauna.durdle.jpg" />

<blockquote>
<p><em>Durdles are shy creatures that like to retreat within their
shells, they move very slowly and sleep for most of the day.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I really couldn’t let you in, not without identification!” A young
worker said, from behind a desk equipped with heavy bars.<br />
    “We don’t have that in Volare!” Lupen said, getting hot in the
face.<br />
    “I see.” The clerk reached for a pamphlet and handed it over to
Lupen through an opening in the bars. The pamphlet read: ‘So you don’t
exist.’<br />
    “What is this?”<br />
    “If you want to exist in the eyes of Montore you need a piece of
identification.”<br />
    “A piece of identification that tells others who I am? That’s
stupid.”<br />
    “It’s the law.”<br />
    The clerk reached under the desk and pulled up a durdle, a creature
with long ears and a spiked shell, it had a tag stuck to one of its
spikes with the writing ‘D-126’. “See. Even D-126 here has an ID.”<br />
    “Okay, <em>fine</em>. Say I want to get an… <em>ahy- dee</em>, where
do I get it?”<br />
    “You’ll need to visit the next stall, Specter<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>. Next!” the clerk
called, eager to move on to another customer.<br />
    “Specter?” Lupen stormed off, looking for that next stall the clerk
had mentioned. The stall was easy to find, it had a long line of people
standing in front of it, a long, long line, snaking around Montore’s
outer wall, and lined with colourful tents.</p>
<p>The city of Montore sat on a hilltop enclosed entirely within a
single, continuous wall, made from rammed earth and decorated with
geometric motifs. The tops of large hempa sails were visible from the
ground, raised high on a ledge atop the wall so that nothing could
disturb the wind. The sails lay over a rotating circular track,
following the whole top of the city wall. The orientation of each sail
changed depending on the wind, their motion was slow, but constant,
powering the city.<br />
    On one end of the city, a wall extension was in progress. Wooden
scaffolding lay in place, with workers standing on the top of the wall
with long ramming poles, pressing and packing the soil down into the
mold.     Lupen approached a young Terin standing in line, “hey, how
long have you been waiting here?”<br />
    “We’ve both been in line for 5 days.” Lupen followed the voice and
turned around, meeting with the forehead of another Terin. “I’m Kuzi.”
Kuzi wore a notcott bandana, a long, white loose-knit shirt, and a
colourful scarf. Kuzi’s line neighbour was indeed unresponsive,
standing, but just barely.<br />
    “Lupen,” Lupen said, “that long? For an ahy- dee?”<br />
    “Yeesh, you’re saying that real weird.”<br />
    “Saying what weird?”<br />
    “Nevermind.” Kuzi said, “waiting in line is a good job. It pays
well, well, it pays enough for a quarter kavava root.”<br />
    “I don’t understand.”<br />
    “Someone’s paying us to wait in line for them, while they stay in
one of those tents out there. When I reach the desk we switch places and
I get paid! There’s always people willing to pay not to wait. They get
what they want, we get what we want, it’s perfect.”<br />
    Lupen estimated that it would take at least seven days to reach the
front desk, “seven days is too long.”<br />
    “Yea, it’s long long, but it’s the only way any of us can afford
kavava root. I just ran out, I’m usually careful to have some left for
my time in line, but you know, it is difficult to reason with yourself
when you’re on kavava,” Kuzi said with a laugh, “can’t believe I went
through the whole thing…”<br />
    Lupen noticed a root laying in the hand of the person standing ahead
of them in line. The Terin was in another world, body swaying slowly
from side to side, mouthing nonsensical words.<br />
    “Every surrogate in this line is here for kavava.” Kuzi said.
    “So everyday, you wait in line to earn coin for kavava, the wait is
so long that you consume your entire kavava supply purchased with the
coin earned from your previous time in line, so when you reach the front
desk you get paid and spend it all on more kavava, then you find someone
else to wait in line because you know you’ll run out again waiting. That
is psychotic Kuzi.”<br />
    “You don’t know anything about anything.”<br />
    Lupen frowned and was about to leave but then asked another
question. “I was wondering, do you know a Zucca?”<br />
    “If I know azucca? What’s azucca.”<br />
    “Zucca. It’s a name.”<br />
    “Azucca’itsaname…? No, sorry. Don’t know one. Hell of a name though,
would sit real long on an ID.”<br />
    “Are you done wasting my time?” Lupen asked, impatiently.<br />
    “Way I see it you’re wasting <em>mine</em>. I might start being
useful if you throw a coin or two my way though…” the Terin said with a
wink, presenting an open hand.<br />
    Already, Lupen hated everything about Montore, even those living
outside its walls. The Verido gave the Terin a rotten look before
walking away.<br />
    “Come on now Specter, I was kidding. It’s a thing called humor,
learn about it! <em>Every</em> Terin <em>knows</em> about Zucca. Has
something of great value I heard. Many go out into the desert to look
for it, but most never make it back. I bet you know that though, being a
friend to Zucca! If you know the location and tell the guards I bet you
and I could get ahead in line real fast! There’s a guard right there,
see? Hey! Hey <em>you</em>! Guard person!”<br />
    Lupen wanted to run away, but the Terin gripped the Verido’s vest
collar. A tall guard in uniform walked towards them.<br />
    “Kuzi, I wish you wouldn’t call me guard person…” The guard said,
offended by this.<br />
    Lupen spied a name on a piece of ID pinned to the front of the
guard’s green blazer, the tag read ‘Averet’.<br />
    “Averet here has a fear of being perceived as ordinary,” Kuzi said,
turning to Lupen.<br />
    Averet’s face turned red. “I’ve got grand ideas! There are plenty of
things I want to do with my life! This is not my forever job you know, I
am <em>not</em> going to spend my life making sure kakava addicts, like
you, don’t fall down a ditch…”<br />
    “This Specter and I know the whereabouts of Zucca!” Kuzi then
blurted out in a hurry, before Lupen could react.<br />
    Lupen tried to deny it all, but the response was delayed, unnatural.
“I’m just a traveling potter! I make pots! I don’t know anything about
anything! Well, I know about pots! But that’s really <em>it</em>!”<br />
    Kuzi knocked on the side of Lupen’s head with a closed fist, as if
to check if it was hollow. “There is definitely something swishing
around in there. And I thought Veridos were good storytellers…”<br />
    “I made this cup!” Lupen said, ignoring Kuzi and showing Averet the
cup Rosmus made. The grey cup was tied to a braided isilk lanyard linked
to Lupen’s belt.<br />
    Kuzi slapped the cup out of Lupen’s hand. “<em>Zucca</em>, Averet!
Come on, you’ve heard of the one with the green place, yea? Well, we’ll
tell you where it is if you let us skip the line.”<br />
    “As if either of you would know where it is, least of all
<em>you</em>, Kuzi.”<br />
    Whenever Lupen tried to tear away, the Terin found some other limb
or piece of clothes to grab onto. As Kuzi tugged away, a norange fell
out of Lupen’s vest pocket and rolled onto the ground.<br />
    Both the guard and Kuzi froze at the sight of it.<br />
    “A norange.” Kuzi said, releasing Lupen and going to grab the
colourful piece of fruit instead. Kuzi held onto it, stroking the bumps
on its surface gently, like stroking the soft hairs on the head of a
newborn. There was a hint of sadness in Kuzi’s eyes. The Terin put a
nose to the fruit, smelling it, and whispering softly into it. Averet
reached forward and tore the fruit away, inspecting it from all
angles.<br />
     “Where did you get <em>this</em>?” A question aimed at Lupen,
although the guard’s eyes were fixed on the fruit.<br />
    Kuzi leapt at Averet and stole the norange before running away,
grabbing Lupen’s arm in passing before darting into the crowd. The guard
rushed after them, but soon lost sight of the two runaways.<br />
     “A norange…” Averet whispered. If it weren’t for the fruit bits
still stuck under these fingernails, Averet would have thought it to be
a hallucination.<br />
    Kuzi stopped running once they had gone far away enough, breathing
hard, the norange in hand.<br />
    “You lost your place in line! Weeks of waiting!” Lupen said.<br />
    “Doesn’t matter,” Kuzi replied, eyes still on the fruit. “You really
were at that oasis.”<br />
    “Yea, you thought I was lying? This was a parting gift. I’d never
heard of noranges until I was given one. My friend knew, though.”<br />
    “Noranges were thought to be extinct. I thought the plant and seed
had gone up in flames with Ministe and the rest. Ah, I love the smell of
noranges warmed by the suns! Some have tried to synthesize the smell and
taste, but it’s not the same. I forgot how fragrant it was. So sweet,
yet so bitter.”<br />
    “You can have it,” Lupen said with a smile. “It’s yours to
eat.”<br />
    “I love the smell, but I also hate it, it brings back memories I’d
prefer to forget.”<br />
    Lupen knew why. After the Iridi raids many Terins had grown
lethargic. They stopped growing food and lost their connection with the
soil. Kuzi’s eyes were set on that fruit, having a silent conversation
with it. The Terin then smiled, breaking out of the trance and throwing
the fruit up in the air before catching it again in mid-flight. “Thanks
for the gift. Seems like I owe you big now, eh? I’ll get you an ID, I’ve
got some connections.”<br />
    “Yea, that’d be great! I need one for my friend Eka, too.”<br />
    “Not a problem,” Kuzi eyed Lupen curiously then, “why do you want to
get into Montore anyway? It sucks in there.”<br />
    “We’re in the mood for some babam cake and tea.”</p>
<p>The next morning, Lupen and Eka went to wait at the foot of the new
wall that was being built. Kuzi had instructed Lupen to wait there, but
now the second sun was nearing midday, and their helper was a no-show.
They wandered back over to the town entrance, making sure to avoid any
guards, while keeping an eye open for Kuzi.<br />
    By then, the story about a Verido in possession of a real norange
had reached the ears of many other Terins. Many of the ones standing in
line for IDs glanced at them as they walked past.<br />
    “Hey!” One of them called out. “Is it true that you’ve met
Zucca?”<br />
    Lupen nodded. “Yes, but keep your voice low.”<br />
    “Got any more of those noranges?” Another yelled.<br />
    Eka did have one left, but wasn’t sure if it was a good idea to say
so.<br />
    “I’ll get you an ID for one!” One Terin said. “I’ve got coin, you
want coin for it? What about kavava?”<br />
    “Uh oh,” said Eka, noticing the amount of attention they were
getting. Some guards turned, tipped off by the many Terins beginning to
encircle them, shouting offers.<br />
    Then, the woth moved out of its glass ball, and reached into Eka’s
pocket, pulling out the last norange. The woth took off with it,
carrying it high and above everyone’s head. Eka let out another “Uh oh,”
followed by, “Humhum come back!” All of the surrogates in line were
staring at the brightly coloured fruit, jumping into the air to try and
grab it. The guards saw it too, now, hurrying over. The woth hovered out
of their reach, and flew over the main entrance and inside the city. A
crowd followed, a mix of surrogates, guards and visitors, all reaching
for the fruit.<br />
    “Norange!”<br />
    “Get it, get it!”<br />
    A mob was chasing the woth inside the city, Eka and Lupen,
following, were able to get inside.<br />
    “That woth is brilliant! A first-class instigator of change! A
genius!” Lupen said, running inside, shouting the war cry: “Cake and
tea!”<br />
    “Cake and tea!” Eka yelled while laughing, mimicking Lupen. “You’re
going to start a riot!”<br />
    “I’m just an opportunist, the woth is the mastermind!”<br />
    The woth landed on top of a high building, setting the norange on a
visible but inaccessible place, and waited. Out came several “ooohs”, as
well as a succession of reverent “aaahs,” from the growing collection of
admirers at the foot of the building.</p>
<p>Eka and Lupen ran deeper into the city, past buildings and street
vendors, until they arrived at the town’s public square, a clear space,
encircled with tiny stalls selling a variety of flavored food
patches.<br />
    “Get your bobonion soup patch here! Best in the city!”<br />
    “In the mood for some mapple pie? Get the patch right here, right
now!”<br />
    The floor of the city was paved with stones, but dusty, with bits of
debris here and there. Young workers stood around with brooms, there to
catch spent patches. The people of Montore threw them over their
shoulders when they were done, mirroring the habit of throwing away
remains of fresh fruits and vegetables. The desert and small critters
consumed the peels quickly, but not the same could be said of those
patches.<br />
    “What do you do with the collected patches?” Eka asked one of the
children.<br />
    The child pointed to a building adjoined to the outerwall.<br />
    “And what happens when the building’s full?”<br />
    The child cocked a head to one side, “I guess they’ll put it in
another building…”</p>
<p>Every house, or business in this city had thick yellow walls made
from a mixture of mud, sand, waterstones and dried grass. They were
constructed in a way to remain cool in the day, and warm once both suns
had set. A large building topped with a dome sat at one end of the
public square, adorned with the Montore insignia, the same symbol
stamped on the face of every coin. A dozen green flags perched on the
roof gave the building some colour.<br />
    In the middle of the city was a thick beam with a large wheel around
it, spinning slowly. Eka noticed that the beam and wheel were connected
to a much larger cog, built under the city. Following one of these long
branches, Eka arrived into a bakery. Inside, another one of these large
beams came out of a hole in the floor, behind the counter where the
baker worked. This secondary beam had a series of smaller branches and
cogs attached to it, leading to a flour mill.<br />
    “Whoa!” Eka said, kneeling down near the hole in the floor around
the beam to catch a glimpse of the underground mechanism. “This is
brilliant!” The city was built on top of a huge cog, powering devices in
the businesses of the city. In the bakery, the beam had an arm that
could be repositioned to power a grain mill, or a dough beater.<br />
    “You shouldn’t mill so much muckwheat!” someone said, “we sell so
little now, no one wants any! Why waste it?”<br />
    The baker sighed, and glanced over at fresh loaf of muckwheat bread.
“People in this town need to be reminded of what real food looks like
and smells like, Ira!”<br />
    “They’re going to shut us down, Avril. We need coin to keep this
place running.”<br />
    Eka overheard the conversation, and was sad to hear it. Eka carried
these words back to Lupen, who had somehow gotten dragged into a Montore
tour group. Leaving it was hard, everyone kept pushing them from one
place to another.<br />
    “The town operates on a schedule!” A tour guide said to a group of
visitors. “During rush horo, the strongest in the city come to give the
master cog a boost by spinning it faster manually! Food patch production
increases dramatically during these times to meet the increased demand,
otherwise, the cog spins at a continuous and consistent speed, made
possible by the outer cog, powered by the wind. But remember, currently
Beobug is trying to build a new system that would remove the need for
wind! Imagine! A city that runs all day, everyday no matter the
weather!”<br />
    Lupen and Eka followed the guide. They found their way into a
factory that made sweet-tasting food patches. On arrival every one was
given a sample, the guide gave Eka and Lupen a babam cake patch.<br />
    “It’s just like having the real thing! Try it!”<br />
    Eka gave the patch a sniff, followed by a quick lick. “Um,” Eka
thought, giving it another lick, “I can sort of taste it.”<br />
    Lupen licked the babam cake patch too, “yea, I mean. It’s
fine?”<br />
    The tour leader continued to talk about the factory. “Our Grand-
Leader Monty had the idea for this wonderful product! It has saved
countless lives, and propelled this city to fame!”<br />
    “Monty?” Lupen said, loud enough for others to hear.<br />
    The entire group turned to look at the Verido.<br />
    “You mean to say you don’t know the Grand-Leader’s name?” One of the
tourists asked.<br />
    “Oh, well I was kidding! Of course I know!”<br />
    “Smooth.” Eka whispered.<br />
    “Yea? Then when’s Monty Day, hm?”<br />
    All eyes were on Lupen. “Um. Today?” Lupen said, tentatively, tipped
off by the decorations in both the town and the factory.<br />
    The group then relaxed. “That’s right! Today is Monty Day,
celebrating the Green Day of our Grand-Leader!”<br />
    Lupen was eager to get away from this group of zealots. As soon as
the tour group made its way to the gift shop, the Verido and Eka snuck
out.<br />
    “I’d like to give this Monty a piece of my mind,” Lupen said,
unimpressed with the factory, as they walked away the Verido continued
to lick the babam cake patch. “I hate the idea of this patch, but I
can’t stop licking it.”<br />
    “It’s not bad,” Eka noted.<br />
    Lupen gave the patch a last, long lick, but then stopped to look at
it. “Now, what do I do with this?”</p>
<p>Eka and Lupen spent time exploring the city, determined to see every
shop that the great cog was powering, like a woodshop, where the cog
turned a metal wheel to cut giant logs.<br />
    Eka wandered into Alkarawin, the oldest library in the Soronan
desert, its emerald-tiled roof visible from anywhere in Montore. The
complex was home to hundreds of ancient texts written by renowned
scholars and thinkers over the years. The library had two giant irinwood
trees guarding the main entrance. The branches of the tree were heavy
with small wooden discs, hanging from thin ropes, each disc had words
carved onto its faces. Visitors who came from far to visit Alkarawin
would come here to offer knowledge to the library, inscribing a short
story, or fact to the wood of a disc. At the end of every annum, these
were removed from the trees, tallied, and gathered to form new texts. A
small basin lay near the door where visitors could wash their hands and
feet, a symbolic act of cleaning the mind and body prior to
entering.<br />
    Clean and centred, Eka entered Alkarawin, and stepped into a square
room, with books lining the walls from floor to ceiling. Books stored
near the ceiling were accessible via a small elevated walkway, built
around the room and accessible with a ladder, this room branched out
into several smaller alcoves, each featuring a unique ornately-painted
yukwood ceiling.<br />
    Eka wandered onto the higher walkway, fingers tracing along names
embossed on the bindings. Eka spotted a blind librarian browsing through
books on a nearby shelf, helping a customer find a specific tome,
fingers reading the text quickly before moving into another section. The
librarian pulled out a book and then handed it over to the visitor in
silence. The visitor breathed a low ‘thank you’, and made for one of the
many reading alcoves. The librarian turned to Eka then, waiting for a
book name. “Habitants of the Dark please,” Eka said, in a quiet voice.
The librarian’s hands returned to the shelves, hunting for the book Eka
requested, they skipped down many rows of books, fingers touching the
wood between each row to identify the right section, and after finding
the correct shelf, the hands stopped, having identified the book. Just
as the worker handed the book to Eka, a horn sounded outside. Eka
thanked the Librarian, and hurried down the stairs, following the
sound.</p>
<p>Outside, the main city square was filling with people, who gathered
around the central beam of the cog. Two Montore guards held a ladder
near the rotating beam. A Finiku walked out of the crowd, climbed the
ladder, and after reaching the top, made a short elegant hop from the
last step to the top of the beam.<br />
    “Dot! Dot! Dot!”<br />
    The crowd cheered. Dot smiled and raised two arms to the sky,
causing the cheer to become even louder.<br />
    “Monty! Monty! Monty!”<br />
    The character standing on the little rotating platform wore a bright
green ensemble with the familiar Montore emblem in the back. “Monty love
you all! And dey tank you for your hard work! Montore can no be great widout you!” The crowd cheered once again at these words.
“Production of food patch ees at all-time high!” The crowd cheered
again, as Dot began to list their yearly accomplishments aloud. Lupen
suddenly remembered Gree’s coin, and pulled it out from a side pocket to
look at it.<br />
    “Oh! How did you get this?” Eka said, eyeing the coin.<br />
    “Gree gave it to me, I don’t know what to do with it though. My
spirit doesn’t feel elevated at all.”<br />
    Eka smirked, grabbed the coin from Lupen’s hand, and disappeared
into the crowd.<br />
    “Eka? Eka! Ah, never mind. I’ll just wait here, <em>alone</em>.”
Moments later, Lupen’s eyes found a familiar face. Kuzi was sitting on a
crate near the bakery. Lupen rushed over. “You forgot to meet us!” The
Verido stopped talking, noticing that like the other Terins in the line
outside of town yesterday, Kuzi too was high on kavava.<br />
    “Oh, hey Lu-Lu!” Kuzi said, smiling stupidly.<br />
    “Kuzi, you didn’t…”<br />
    Kuzi looked at the Verido with red eyes, and groaned. “I didn’t even
taste the norange. Not one bite. I’m <em>so</em> weak.”<br />
    Lupen sat down, shoulder to shoulder with Kuzi. Both said nothing,
sitting together with Dot’s voice in the background. Just then the woth
returned, carrying a small bit of norange peel around. Lupen grabbed the
peel, and handed it over to Kuzi, “you can taste it now.” The Terin
pushed it away.<br />
    “No. I don’t like how it makes me feel.”<br />
    A curious onlooker noticed the norange peel. “Norange!” Word of the
norange on the rooftop had traveled, everyone in town knew about it. Dot
stopped speaking then, words falling on deaf ears as the crowd gathered
around Lupen. There was nowhere to run this time. The guards arrived,
recognizing both Kuzi and Lupen.<br />
    “You two!” The guard gripped Lupen’s arm, then began to search for
the piece of ID. “What! No ID either?! We’ve got a Specter here!”<br />
    “I’ve got ID! I exist! See? <em>See</em>?” Kuzi yelled, fumbling
around for it, but the guard didn’t want to hear it, and both were
dragged away from the main square and into the courtyard of building
with the Montore emblem, and were asked to stay there.</p>
<p>The space was enclosed by 4 walls, with two doors, one leading inside
the courtyard, the other, inside of the main building. Unlike most of
Montore, this place was a lush garden, bursting with colour and life. A
giant yukwood tree grew in the centre, providing shelter from the high
midday suns.<br />
    Lupen thought the place beautiful, but wondered what lay beyond the
second door. Like the first, it was a heavyset door with deep carvings
of intertwining branches and leaves, and a single golden knob in its
centre.<br />
    Kuzi gave Lupen a shove. “Why’d you have to get me involved?! Is
babam cake and tea code for something?”<br />
    “I didn’t do anything! Everyone here just gets real crazy whenever
there’s mention of noranges! I didn’t know that would happen!”<br />
    “You can’t just go flaunting extinct fruits around!” Kuzi realized
something then. “That’s how you got into the city.”<br />
    “Yea, me and a ton of others.” Lupen smirked. “Another
accident.”<br />
    “They’re going to put us into a mill and grind us into food
patches!” Kuzi yelled.<br />
    “It’s your fault! You were supposed to meet us, but instead you went
on a kavava bender!”<br />
    Kuzi began to fight Lupen in the courtyard, although the fight
occurred mostly on one side, and less so on the other. The Verido didn’t
know how to fight, and instead made a dance of it, avoiding the
onslaught of fists with ease because Kuzi’s movements were sluggish,
still high on root juices. Their fight was interrupted by Averet, the
guard.<br />
    “Hey! Stop that!” Averet instructed them to follow, and brought them
in front of a large door, made of carved banabo. “Whom does this belong
to?” Averet asked, holding the norange peel.<br />
    Lupen didn’t put a claim to it, having no desire to get ground up
into anything. Kuzi addressed Averet then. “How would I have a norange?
I was raised here and never left, same as you.”<br />
    The guard blinked, then gripped Lupen’s arm. “Right. Come with me,
Specter.”<br />
    “I bet the food patch version of you will be <em>disgusting</em>!”
Kuzi shouted, just as another guard arrived to escort the Terin
outside.</p>
<p>Lupen gulped as the large carved banabo door opened, revealing a
thick curtain, obscuring both the room and its occupant. “Go,” Averet
said, pushing the captive onward. Lupen took a few steps forward, found
an opening in the fabric and pushed on. A young Terin, dressed in a
green robe was on the other side. “You’re the Specter, the norange
smuggler?”<br />
    “Smuggler? That’s escalating things a bit don’t you think?”<br />
    “Follow me,” the young Terin said, pushing past yet another set of
curtains. On the other side, Lupen’s fingers found moss clinging to the
fabric. Small trees grew from holes in the ground, their roots raising
the tiled flooring. There was a large gap in the ceiling, bringing light
into the room. The walls were covered with notes, and drawings. A large
ornate table lay at the centre of the room, buried in a blanket of
greens, with plants wrapping around its legs. Some of the chairs
encircling the table lay on their sides, with pieces broken off, used to
build other projects. A painting of the table as it once was hung on the
wall.<br />
    “The norange thief is here.”<br />
    “What? I’m no thief!” Lupen retorted.<br />
    A Terin with greying hair and a thin young face rose from behind the
table, head reaching just over a mound of moss. “Where did you get that
norange?” The Terin asked, nonchalantly, speaking low and slow while
bending down again to check over the leaves of a nearby plant.<br />
    “If I said, I’d betray a friend and endanger lives,” Lupen replied,
bending down to look under the table to see what the Terin was doing.
“I’m sure I don’t have to tell you who it’s from though…”<br />
    “You are correct. I am happy to learn that Zucca was able to save
some norange seeds,” the Terin said, moving from one plant to another,
“norcorn patties just aren’t the same without norange sauce.”<br />
    Lupen observed that the Terin wore a simple pair of tan hempa pants,
scuffed at the knees. “So um, are you Monty?”<br />
    Monty stood up again, slowly, to look at Lupen only to find that
Lupen’s head wasn’t there. “Not what you were expecting?”<br />
    Lupen mimicked Monty’s movements, and stood up again. “No, not at
all… you’ve got all these plants, yet you’re feeding others false food,
then there’s the Beobug goons and their sandfins. Hard to believe it all
comes from you.”<br />
    Monty laughed. “It’s been a while since I’ve heard someone attacking
me for my ideas,” Monty said, yellow eyes now fixed on Lupen.<br />
    “Yea well, I’ve got a problem with pain, and misery,” Lupen
replied.<br />
    Monty smiled, composed and calm as ever. “The food patches helped
feed refugees during the Iridi raids.”<br />
    “Did you know that Beobug employees sell expired patches to the
hungry for coin?” Lupen was proud of this rebuttal.<br />
    Monty thought about this for a moment. “And you’re blaming
me.”<br />
    “Yes, yes I am.”<br />
    “I don’t have as much control over others as you might think.”<br />
    “People in this city aren’t eating real food anymore, and everyone
is obssessed with coin…” Lupen wanted to stop talking but the words kept
coming out.<br />
    “Coin was supposed to be a way to simplify exchanges in the city. It
was really a good idea, but great ideas have a way of growing, and
changing as more and more heads and hands get involved, and big ideas
require more hands and heads. I’ve let go of the helm many, many annums
ago. I had more energy back then, it was easier to steer, but now…”
Monty sighed, “I just decided to stop having ideas.”<br />
    Lupen took note of all the drawings and books scattered in the room,
clearly Monty wasn’t done having ideas. “You mean you decided to stop
telling others about them.”<br />
    “Yes, I suppose you’re right. The giant cog was my first idea, my
best one. It is designed to run forever you know, with little
maintenance, but then no one can do anything when the wind is down.
Waiting didn’t used to be a problem, but the city has grown, and with
all the transients we get demand is increasing and Montore can no longer
afford to wait. The new system will work day and dark..”<br />
    “Did you ever tell anyone all of this? That it’s a bad idea? Maybe
if they heard it from you they’d stop?”<br />
    “Those who live in Montore see it as an undivided blessing. For me
to criticize modernity is to criticize the needs and wants of my city,
and of those we invite within its walls.” Monty replied.<br />
    “So Montore will just keep growing forever, and ever?” Lupen
said.<br />
    “You would have me kick people out to reduce demand?” Monty asked
the Verido. “Just as the wind changes the shape of dunes in the desert,
Montore will too be shaped by those who inhabit it. I’ve decided to
instead focus on this room, it is small, and because it is small, I only
need my own head and hands and I quite like that.” Monty stood up then,
and began to walk around the room, stretching arms and legs and stopping
in front of a large portrait hanging on a wall.<br />
    Lupen took note of a painting on the backwall, it resembled the
portrait carved on the coin, “that looks nothing like you.”<br />
    “If I were to go out there on the city square right now, they
wouldn’t believe I was Monty.” Monty too stared at the painting, then
turned so Lupen could compare details. “My artist got carried away, they
thought I needed to look more imposing, more angular. It’s why I’m here
really, and that no one can see me. If they did, they’d throw me out,
thinking I was a pretender. Anyway, I am tired. Dot has the helm now.
Staying here, at least I’m safe and free to think up ideas all day,
everyday…”<br />
    “Yea. You’re comfortable while people suffer.”<br />
    “People have suffered long before your time and mine. I was
wondering, how did you get Zucca to give you that fruit?”<br />
    Lupen bore a sad expression, eyeing the entrance. “If you want to
know the full story you’ll have to walk out of here with me. How about
it? It’s Monty Day after all.”<br />
    Monty smirked, “I would have really enjoyed hearing that story. For
you to know, and me to wonder I suppose.” Saying this, the grand leader
continued to look after the plants in the room, checking the leaves for
signs of malnutrition with much love and care, like a leafhound
would.<br />
    “Why did you ask me in here?” Lupen asked.<br />
    “Curiosity. A Verido with a norange, a hyroo and a round-eared
companion together, <em>very</em> unusual.” Saying this, Monty glanced
at Lupen once again, the pair of yellow eyes appeared focused, quietly
dissecting the visitor.<br />
    “I’ll add that story to the pile, in exchange for you to tell your
people the truth.” Lupen teased.<br />
    “Goodbye Specter.”<br />
    Lupen let out a deep sigh, there was nothing to do then but leave.
The Verido glanced at Monty’s second hand. “What now? What happens to
the ones who don’t exist in the eyes of Montore? Do I get ground up into
food?”<br />
    The green-clad Terin laughed, “the things people think we do.
Sometimes I wonder why we bother making laws at all, stories like this
keep people in line better than our laws ever could.” With this, Lupen
was escorted out of the building. “You need to leave the city right this
instant.” Monty’s second hand watched as Lupen stepped into the main
square, and heading towards the city gate. The guard kept close, to make
sure the Verido didn’t decide to take a detour on the way out.<br />
    As Lupen was escorted out of Montore, Kuzi stood by, watching. Eka
stood near too, chewing loudly, eating chunks of freshly baked babam
cake. “D’you know where I can get some mepperpint tea around
here?”<br />
    Kuzi looked over, catching the scent of fresh babam. “No, I don’t
really know.”<br />
    “Do you want some?” Eka offered, putting a slice of cake under the
Terin’s nose. “I could eat it all myself, but that would make me a
glutton. You eating a bit would make me feel like less of one.”<br />
    Kuzi was hungry, having forgotten to buy some food patches. “Sure,
more for you than for me though.” Kuzi bit into the pastry. The texture
was bouncy, and airy, it offered little resistance. A piece was torn
off, and passed to the next point in line. This experience of eating was
so intense, so enjoyable, that Kuzi began to shiver. “There’s gingin in
it! I love gingin! Well, I used to…”<br />
    “Enjoy it, this is likely the last cake the bakery will ever make.
It’s closing tomorrow, not enough people buying food. A real shame. They
make amazing breads too, Avril and Ira I mean, they’re the real deal!
Soon they’ll be gone. Extinct, like the noranges.”<br />
    Kuzi stopped chewing, feeling sad. This was usually the point where
the Terin would start ingesting some mind-numbing kavava…<br />
    “Oh! Now I remember,” Eka began, “Avril’s grandmapa Moki was the one
making the mepperpint tea! The shop had a garden outside, it was a
popular place back in the day. Some Terin was working there too, the
only one who really understood mepperpint. I miss it. But you know… if
you drink too much of it—”<br />
    “—It makes your eyes sprout leaves,” Kuzi finished, with a weak
smile.<br />
    Eka nodded. “Exactly! Alright. Have some more cake. I’m going to go
for a walk now.”<br />
    Kuzi stood there, a giant slice of babam cake in hand, staring at
the bakery. For some reason, Kuzi had forgotten it existed, stuck in a
perpetual kavava haze. The fog had cleared, and the world had much more
detail in it. Without a moment’s hesitation, and drawn by the smell of
muckwheat, the Terin walked to the bakery and went inside.</p>
<p>Lupen was at their tent outside of the city, waiting for Eka to
return. Hush was there, conversing with the woth, listening to a
re-telling of today’s events.<br />
    Eka arrived before darkfall, finding Lupen in the tent, but there
was something different, something unusual…<br />
    “You’ve got a cup on your head, you know that right?”<br />
    “It’s a Thinking Cup,” Lupen said, with a sigh, knowing all-too-well
how ridiculous it looked.<br />
    “Wow! Is it working? Are you having some great thoughts right
now?”<br />
    Lupen removed the cup then, staring into it. “No. Maybe it’s because
there’s no tea in it…”<br />
    Eka presented a slice of babam cake to the dispirited Verido. “I did
not find mepperpint tea, but this cake stands well enough on its own.
Try it.”<br />
    “Mission failed,” Lupen said.<br />
    “How so?”<br />
    “On getting some Montore babam cake and mepperpint tea.”<br />
    “No, I think our excursion into Montore was a success! We learned
many things today, and we made lots of friends.”<br />
    “Friends? Everyone here thinks I’m a fiend. Did you not see my walk
of shame?”<br />
    “I did, I did! You’re Montore-famous now!”<br />
    “Great,” Lupen moaned, “but I was hoping we could help
somebody…”<br />
    Eka hugged Lupen then, “is that what you think we’re doing? Helping
others?”<br />
    “Yes? Maybe? I don’t know.”<br />
    “We came here for cake and tea.”<br />
    “Yea. Yea, you’re right,” saying this, Lupen took a bite of the
babam cake. “Oh wow! This is <em>so</em> good!” The woth moved out of
its glass house, eager to get a bite of this famed pastry, even Hush was
intrigued. “I’m not sharing, sorry!” Lupen said, but both approached,
eager to sample the remaining chunk of cake. Lupen was pinned to the
floor, with Hush chewing on the end of the cake and the woth eating
stray crumbs off its snout. “Yea yea, you’ve got two stomachs…”<br />
    The next day, the gang packed up their tent and gear and left
Montore.</p>
<p>Later that same day, Kuzi had sold the last of the kavava in exchange
for coin to pay for more pastries at the bakery. This sell, helped to
convince Ira to keep the bakery open, at least for another day or two.
Kuzi sat in the city square, looking at the townspeople, and ate
bread.<br />
    “Hey Kuzi, keeping out of trouble today I hope,” Averet said.<br />
    “For now,” Kuzi replied with a grin.<br />
    There was a pause, but Averet spoke again. “Do you know where I can
get some norcorn patties around here?”<br />
    “I’d ask Avril’s bakery.”<br />
    “Bakery?”<br />
    Kuzi pointed to it. “Yea, it’s where I got this bread. You want to
try some?”<br />
    Averet grabbed a slice of bread, and took a bite. “It’s <em>so</em>
moist! Why do I never buy real bread? Thanks, I’ll visit Avril later, to
ask about the norcorn. You see, I kept this piece of norange peel…”</p>
