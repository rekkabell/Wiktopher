<blockquote>
<p><em>Papilions travel with the wind and in the hairs of passing
habitants of the Soronan desert. It is said that when they find suitable
soil, they burrow and later grows into Hespers. ‘Having papilions in
your throat’, means being kept from speaking due to anxiety.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>    “So! If the tunnels <em>are</em> guarded, how are <em>we</em>
going to get in?” Lupen asked, standing in Hush’s shadow. The suns were
very hot today, but the large furry beast did not seem to mind.<br />
    “In? No no no,” Eka said, head shaking in a Nono sort-of-way.<br />
    Lupen’s eyes narrowed down. “So… no to noodles then?”<br />
    “Yes to noodles! That hasn’t changed.” Eka replied, mouth watering.
“The monks live in a tower overlooking Irideri, set on the highest peak
of the Andenuis. It lies <em>just</em> outside of Irideri, that’s what
Aristollo says in the book I borrowed anyway…”<br />
    Lupen’s eyes widened at that name. “What did you just say?”<br />
    Eka grabbed the book and opened it to the first page, the title
<em>Habitants of The Dark</em> was written in black ink, and underneath
it, was the name Aristollo.<br />
    “No way!” Lupen grabbed the volume, as if happening upon a rare
flower. “A writer,” Lupen began flipping through the pages, wondering if
there was any information about the author. There wasn’t. “Why didn’t
you tell me Aristollo was a writer?”<br />
    “You didn’t ask.”<br />
    “So Aristollo was in Irideri back then, when it was closed off to
everyone! How did the book make it out? What <em>else</em> do you know?”
Lupen’s curiosity grew with every mention of the name.<br />
    “It’s not my story to tell.” Eka said, grabbing the volume again to
put it away in the bag hanging from Hush’s side.<br />
    “You think the monks would know?”<br />
    Eka shrugged. “Only way to know is if we go!”<br />
    “So if all goes well we’ll get to eat chloromyce noodles up in monk
tower, to catch a far-away glimpse of a city we’re not physically
allowed to visit, but all of this depends on whether or not we find the
tower, and whether or not the monks allow us to eat their noodles. Oh,
and guards might catch us. Did I miss anything?” Lupen asked.<br />
    “With iridescent feet! It’s worth a try! I mean, the city’s been
closed to foreigners for something like…fa, no…” Eka paused, counting up
the number of annums inaudibly, “two haty’annums[^]!”<br />
    “Not <em>that</em> many, couldn’t have been <em>that</em> long.”
Lupen said.<br />
    “Were you there Lu?” Eka asked, nose pressing up onto Lupen’s.<br />
    “N-no.” Even after all the time they’d spent together, being so
close always made this Verido uncomfortable. “Wait, maybe I was! No one
is ever nothing, that’s what you said! I was a seed, probably? Well, no
maybe not even that… but I <em>was</em> something!”<br />
    Eka’s hands came to rest over the sides of Lupen’s face. The
Wonder’s delicate fingers traced along the blue patterns etched in the
Verido’s skin. “That’s right. You are a lovely strand Lu, everchanging,
but never gone.”<br />
    Lupen’s ears began to redden, and the rest of the face followed
suit. “Haty’annum and a quarter! I read it in a book once.”<br />
    Eka’s eyes moved past Lupen’s left shoulder, focused on some distant
object. “Whoa! Look at that! Someone’s there!”<br />
    Lupen groaned. “I really, really <em>hate</em> this game.” Red’s
eyes could see mirages for what they were, but the same couldn’t be said
for Verido eyes. This gave the Wonder an opportunity to get a few laughs
at Lupen’s expense. The last time they had encountered such an event,
Lupen had asked a mound of sand for directions, the time before that,
the Verido had a very long and embarrassing one-sided conversation with
a tree about the nutritional benefits of bibiskiss. The worse thing was
the tree, <em>my</em> hallucination, didn’t even agree with me, Lupen
thought.<br />
    “It’s true! The truest of truths! Has a funny-looking head
too!”<br />
    “You really think me a fool don’t you?” Lupen wasn’t ready to be
made fun of again, not so soon. Hush lifted a nose to the sky, trying to
catch a scent. For a second, the Verido wondered if Hush, too, was in on
this joke. Risking humiliation once again, Lupen turned around to try
and see what Eka was pointing to. “Oh, so there is! Never seen anyone
with a head like <em>that</em>.”<br />
    “A hat then? Hats do have a tendency to get more and more outrageous
with time. A hatter I met in Montore some annums ago made one so large
it doubled as a dwelling.” Eka said, arms extending outward, to show the
size of said hat.<br />
    Hush carried them over to a lone figure sitting on hot sands, it had
a large metal prism for a head, it had many faces, each one bore a
symbol. There was no order to it, no logic, the faces were sized
differently and there was no repetition in the symbols themselves. When
they called out to the prism-headed stranger, the figure recoiled,
curling into an even smaller shape.<br />
    “That’s not a head.” Eka said. A symbol lay burned onto this being’s
back, a circle with a diamond shape in its centre. “That’s the Irideri
emblem.” There was also a character carved in the flesh of the
stranger’s neck…<br />
    “Ten.” Lupen and Eka said aloud together.<br />
    “That’s not an Iridi is it? Would they do this to their own?”<br />
    “Eka sighed.”No, you’re right they wouldn’t. This is an
Aodal.”<br />
    “Aodals are much taller than this usually aren’t they?” Lupen asked,
saddened by the thought of someone suffering like this.<br />
    “Stunted growth,” Eka said, “from malnutrition, and from living in
the dark. Workers in the Irideri mines aren’t allowed chloromyce, and
because they don’t get any, they get sick.”<br />
    Hush had a nose to the ground, catching a nearby scent, the hyroo
followed it and stopped at a mound, pushing sand off the top with its
snout, off of something that was buried there. First, a shrivelled hand
came into view, then a torso. Hush continued to brush sand off,
revealing the rest of it. It was small, grey, wrinkly, with skin like
leather, and like Ten, this body also had a character carved into its
neck.<br />
    “F.”<br />
    Lupen and Eka began to dig through the soil, both had the same idea.
F couldn’t be left here for someone else to find. They put the body in
the hole and Lupen placed a piece of cloth over F’s face, then they
covered the body with a thick duvet of golden sand. The two stood at the
place where the hole had been, hand in hand.<br />
    “What do Verido say on Leaping Days in Volare?” Eka asked.<br />
    “We say nothing. We instead focus on recalling good memories with as
much detail as we can. Then, we take those good thoughts into ourselves,
thusly preserving our loved ones in our hearts.” Lupen’s hand closed
into a tight fist, coming to rest over the heart. Eka did the same.
Lupen’s attention turned to the prism-headed creature sitting on the
ground. “They send their workers out into the desert with metal heads.
Why?”<br />
    “Punishment? Sending them out here with those things on is a death
sentence. They can’t eat or drink, plus there’s the heat of the suns.
They don’t last long out here.” Eka whistled for Hush to move near Ten,
to shield the prisoner from the suns. Ten reacted to the change in
temperature, hands coming to rest over the burnt flesh. “Lu, put a hand
to Ten’s chest, and then take Ten’s hand onto yours. I’ll do the same.
After that we won’t be strangers anymore.” Eka said with a soft
smile.<br />
    Lupen did as told. After Eka had done the same, both noticed that
Ten appeared more relaxed.<br />
    “I bet they put those heads on as a warning to others too, of what
can happen if you mess with Iridi people.” Lupen sighed. “How are you so
great in situations like this?” Lupen asked Eka, “you’re calm and always
seem to know just what to do…”<br />
    “When it comes to helping others it comes easy, had you been alone
you’d done the same.” Eka’s fingers traced over the prism on Ten’s head.
The shapes and pieces on its surface were not random, every one could be
pushed and moved to a new place. It was an elaborate puzzle. Eka soon
stopped touching it, realizing that every bad move resulted in the prism
shrinking. There was no way to pry it off this poor child’s head. “We
can’t leave Ten here and we know we can’t go to Irideri. There’s a
village just a day’s walk away, we’ll go there.”<br />
    The woth slipped out of its glass ball and fluttered ahead to show
them the way.<br />
    “How does it know where to go?” Lupen wondered.<br />
    “Good internal compass,” Eka replied, chasing down the woth as it
disappeared in the distance. “Slow down Plit!” Eka called out to the
woth.<br />
    “Do you really think that any woth in its right mind would answer to
the name Plit? Oh no… what if this woth actually <em>is</em> crazy? What
if its name is a sentence, and that the sentence isn’t actually a
sentence at all but a succession of random words? Or that the words are
not words but just strings of random letters? What then!? This woth is
crazy Eka!” Lupen said. The Verido was relieved to see that it did not,
in fact, answer to Plit, although there was no real way to know if the
woth was of sound mind or not.<br />
    Hush bounded forward, carrying Ten on its back. Soon, Lupen joined
in, climbing behind Ten to make sure that their guest wouldn’t slip
off.</p>
<p>It took them half a day’s time to get to the village, with Eka and
Lupen taking turns on Hush. They arrived at the famed tent village of
Renate.<br />
    Historically, Renate was an open bazaar, a place of exchange with no
permanent residents. Nowadays, many artisans made Renate their home, but
still kept to the tradition of temporary housing. Most tents were kept
up by flexible banabo poles and had walls of fabric, offering less
resistance to wind while providing a cool shelter. Each tent was unique,
with walls of varying colours and patterns, some were weaved from banabo
fibre, others from lesser-known materials like hampa, or notcott. There
was no visible organization for the placement of the tents, in fact this
village had few rules, and no official leader. The people here liked it
that way, Eka said.<br />
    When they arrived, they approached a group of children playing in an
open area between tents, they’d heard of these prism-headed prisoners,
but didn’t have time to answer questions because all of their attention
quickly turned to Hush. The children combed the hyroo’s fur with their
fingers, along with repeated ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’. This caught the
attention of an older villager, who’d been busy sifting sand and rock
from a batch of freshly dug lanivanil bleens. The villager left the
basket and bleens on the ground and hurried over, urging the kids to
move away.<br />
    “Hush is not dangerous.” Lupen said.<br />
    After successfully shooing the kids away, the villager shook their
head, “nan nan. Nan ti…” and then pointed a finger toward Ten
“<em>ti</em> estre! Volubi, seklo vi. Rappida!”<br />
     “Follow me, quickly,” Eka translated the end of the conversation.
They could sense the fear in the villager’s eyes. They were led to a
large tent on the outskirts of town. They could hear the sound of
someone beating into a piece of metal inside.<br />
    “Atedu nio citi.” The villager said, slipping into the tent.<br />
    “Are we in trouble?” Lupen asked Eka, “also, what language is
that?”<br />
    “Aodan, and no no, we’re fine.” Eka replied.<br />
    The clanging stopped. A tall and brawny character stepped out,
eyeing the one with the prism for a head. “I’ll take care of it
Lussa.”<br />
    “Danki, danki Maka,” Lussa said, bowing to the two strangers before
scurrying away, disappearing behind a row of tents.<br />
    The group was hushed inside, as if they had a secret that needed to
stay hidden. They learned that the tent owner’s name was Maka, a
metalworker, thick with muscle. The metalworker’s body appeared to be
made of rock. Maka had short white hair, crowning the head and face.
Maka showed great interest in Ten. “No one’s ever found one alive. I’ve
tinkered with one other of those head prisons, found it on the desert
floor. Couldn’t keep it for long though, it had to be returned because
those Irideri guards come and look for them.”<br />
    “Really? Why would they do that?” Lupen asked.<br />
    “Maybe they can’t make more…” Eka mused.<br />
    “That’s a good guess,” Maka said, “but we don’t really know, truth
is we prefer to leave the metal heads where they are, because having
them around scares people. No one here wants to give the Iridi a reason
to threaten us again. It’s why Lussa brought you here, we don’t want
anyone to see. The young ones aren’t afraid because they haven’t lived
through the Raids, but the older generation fear anything that has to do
with the Iridi. They won’t want the prisoner to stay here for that
reason.” Maka walked over to Ten, inspecting the poor child’s wounds.
“Poor kid looks very weak, I have something for that,” Maka helped the
young prisoner to the far side of the tent. “So,” Maka began, “why help
a stranger?” The metalworker helped the child onto a bed and began
applying medicine to the wounds.<br />
    “I suffer from acute empathy.” Eka said.<br />
    Alarms went off in Lupen’s head then, the brain opening up thought
drawers in succession, searching for an answer that too, would impress,
but the drawers produced no such miracle. “Can you <em>believe</em> it?
I wanted to say that <em>exact</em> same thing! Embarrassing when that
happens! When you have the exact same thought as someone else, but they
say it first and you wanna be an individual so you <em>try</em> to come
up with something new, that is, you know, unique, but you can’t because
that first thought was just so, so good…”<br />
    Maka stared for a while, then started to laugh with gusto. “You’ve
got beautiful minds. I like you both already.” The brawny Aodal walked
back over to their side of the room, with a box in hand, taking a seat
on a metal stool that Lupen could tell, had been handcrafted. “I can’t
open the prism, but I know someone who can help you.”<br />
    Lupen’s face brightened at these words. “Really?”<br />
    “Possibly. It’s a topic I’ve long avoided with my apprentice, but
everyone has to face up to their past sometime, don’t you agree? I’ll
take you over there after lunch, you two must be starving!” The
metalworker reached into a box, a sort of cooling box, similar to the
cold pot in Lupen’s house in Volare, and pulled out some teaweet bread,
jam and dried sausages. Maka began to cut slices of teaweet bread,
laying the pieces out onto a wooden board along with some the sausages.
“My apprentice came to Renate many annums ago, broken and near-dead.
Villagers here were ready to cast the poor thing back out into the
desert, who can blame them… Iridi have a bad reputation in these parts,
I’m sure I don’t have to tell you why…”<br />
    “Your apprentice is an Iridi?” Eka said, surprised.<br />
    “That’s right.” Maka uncovered a crock of spiced mapple jam, scooped
out a portion for the group and ladded it into a small wooden bowl
before setting it down with the rest of the food. “Eat, eat! All local
products. Made those plant sausages myself, a mix of spices, teaweet
flour, bobonions, nutshroos and plurple bleens.”</p>
<p>                                            ~</p>
<p>    <strong>Sausages</strong></p>
<p>    <em>Ingredients</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>    One medium size bobonion<br />
    Three bushels of nutshroos<br />
    Two minced gewrik cloves<br />
    One full stalk of stemmed aroot bleens<br />
    Five dips of fermented choko paste<br />
    One avoka nut<br />
    Tree sprigs of smoked papakitas<br />
    Two crushed lemilims<br />
    Three crumbed slices of teaweet<br />
    Six stalks of plurple bleens, stemmed and floured</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    <em>Instructions</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>    Mince the bobonion and the nutshroos. Sauté together with the oil
from a cracked avoka until they have softened, and that all of the water
from the nutshroos has evaporated.<br />
    Add all of the other ingredients to a stone bowl and mix together
into a smooth batter. Using a heavy pestle will make the job easier. Add
a bit more plurple flour if it’s too moist.<br />
    Take some of the batter and roll it into sausages, pan-fry with some
avoka oil and serve with your choice of topping!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>                                            ~</p>
<p>    Lupen and Eka thanked their host, grabbed a slice of teaweet
bread, and added a dab of mapple jam with a slice of sausage on top. Eka
took a bite, but hesitated to take another. “Ten must be
starving…”<br />
    Ten was still resting in the corner, Maka didn’t look concerned.
“Don’t worry, Ten ate. It was the first thing I did. It’s my number one
rule: empty bellies must be filled at once!”<br />
    Lupen didn’t understand. “How?”<br />
    “Food patches.” Maka explained, pulling one out of the pocket of a
work apron.<br />
    Lupen couldn’t believe it. “Oh, not <em>those</em> again…”<br />
    Maka laughed. “Yes I hear you, not everyone likes these, but when
the Iridi were attacking the cities, everyone was on the run and these
saved many lives. Good nutritious food was hard to come by, health
problems arose and these came in useful. A sandfin comes by every now
and then, always brings a crate-full of the stuff. Not one of those
Beobug scammers, a solo traveler, on a sandfin with a yellow hull.
Renate suffered much loss during the Iridi raids a stranger brought us
our first crate. Kindness was in short supply in those days, you can
imagine the look on the people’s faces when a tall stranger arrived here
with it”.<br />
    “<em>Tall</em> you say?” Lupen glanced over at Eka, half-expecting a
reaction, but the Wonder had other preoccupations.<br />
    “Think I can give a few slices of teaweet to Hush?”<br />
    Maka smirked. “Kids outside are giving your friend plenty of good
grub, saw them trailing behind Lussa with basket-fulls of
nutshroos.”<br />
    “Oh, I hope they’ll figure out that Hush will eat as long as there’s
food. That hyroo’s appetite is insatiable, it’s been compared to the
Rupture, in the way that it has no bottom.”<br />
    “I’ll let the kids know.” Maka said with a warm smile.</p>
<p>After the meal, Eka, Lupen, Maka and Ten marched over to the
apprentice’s home, erected far from all others. The tent had no visible
openings, all the panels were bound with clumsy, heavy stitching. Some
panels looked better than others, it seemed that its maker had improved
over time. It was tradition in Renate that all who came to live here,
make their own tent from thread and needle, with local materials. Maka’s
apprentice had a different life before, not one where you were taught
the art of thread-work. “You have to promise not to tell anyone that Iri
is in Renate.” Maka whispered.<br />
    “Iri?” Lupen said, “that’s a derogatory name isn’t it?”<br />
    “I know it is, but my apprentice insists on it,” Maka explained. “So
you won’t tell right?”<br />
    “Promise!” Eka said.<br />
    Lupen also chimed in. “Will tell no one.”<br />
    “Good, good. You see, Iri did not leave Irideri by choice. My
apprentice served in the Court of Light, but deserted after an
unfortunate series of events. Iri will not like that I’ve told you this,
but I have a feeling that I can trust you.” Maka found an opening in the
tent and put a head inside. “Iri, some people here to see you.”<br />
    “For work?” Iri asked from inside.<br />
    “Yes, you can call it work.” Maka said, turning to the three
visitors, whispering. “Whatever you do, you’ve got to make Iri help you.
Do not leave this tent without the promise of help.”<br />
    Eka and Lupen nodded, hands searching for a gap in the fabric of the
tent, after finding it they slipped inside. The outer fabric of the tent
was thick, it kept most of the light out.<br />
    Iri rose when they entered. The apprentice had a thin face and an
equally thin build, a loose hampa knit shirt hung off of one shoulder.
The Iridi’s hair was short, dark and wavy. Iri’s eyes were black, well
adapted to a life out of the sun. “Who are you?” Iri asked, scanning
them from head to toe.<br />
    “That’s Eka, I’m Lupen and this one is… well, we call this one Ten.”
Lupen dragged the youngling from behind them, putting the prism into
full view of their host.<br />
    Iri’s eyes widened as shameful memories of Irideri came streaming
back. The face of their host seemed to have gone an even paler shade of
grey. “Better to spend your energy on the living,” the apprentice said,
inaudibly cursing at Maka for sending those strangers over here.
Thoughts of Irideri were irritating, Iri made a point of never thinking
about that place.<br />
    “You must not have helped many to say this.” Lupen said. Eka elbowed
the Verido, insulting their host would not help their case.<br />
    “I don’t deny it. I don’t help the dead. It’s pointless.” Iri said,
uncaring.<br />
    “From what Maka told us, you were near dead too when you first
walked into Renate. People helped you,” Lupen retorted.<br />
    The changes in Iri’s face were small, eyebrows furrowed slightly,
the apprentice was angry but appeared annoyed most of all. These subtle
face twitches did not rightly convey the Iridi’s true feelings. “I still
had a leg to stand on. This prisoner will never be rid of that head.
Within seven days, Ten will be dead and you will have needlessly
burdened yourselves with guilt over it.”<br />
    “Is that the truth?” Lupen asked, “Maka said you would know what to
do.”<br />
    “Maka was wrong.”<br />
    Eka insisted. “Please help. You <em>must</em> know
<em>something</em>.”<br />
    The apprentice appeared to be troubled, remembering what had
happened all of those annums ago, when arriving here in the village…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>    “You have to let me in. I can’t go back out into the wilds, I’ll
die!” A young Renzo, dressed in tattered traditional Iridi robes was
standing at the Renate city border, hair disheveled, the veil of
perfection gone. Renzo’s legs were travel-worn and threatened to buckle,
but the pride of an Iridi was such that one would never kneel or show
signs of weakness, even when in pain.<br />
    Renzo had first sought refuge at the city of Edonor, but met a lot
of hostility there. Many disapproved of the presence of an Iridi,
whispering insults under their breath. “How dare you come into our city
with <em>that</em> face!” They would say. “Do you wish for death?”<br />
    To the older residents of Edonor, this stranger was a harbinger of
war, many still carried scars of that time. Seeing an Irideri soldier
stroll through town was cause for concern, were there others coming? Was
this the beginning of another time of fear under Iridi rule? Not all
were reserved in their hatred, some would come near, ready to fight.
Renzo, young and fearless, did not take kindly to insults, which only
served to aggravate things.<br />
    The city of Irideri had been closed off to the outside for many
annums, but that did nothing to soothe the pains inflicted on the land
during the Raids. No Iridi of this generation knew how the rest of the
world perceived them, their history books gave no account of all the
death and pain. Renzo was the first Iridi to step foot in Edonor since
the raids had ended. That day, Renzo discovered what awaited residents
of Irideri dumb enough to leave the security of the Andenuis. Some
residents of Edonor had pain in their hearts, and revenge on their
minds. There was another city, a village, a day’s walk away called
Renate, but like Edonor the people there too had knives for eyes.<br />
    “If the desert wants you dead, there’s no escaping it.” One of the
Renate villagers said, throwing a stone. “Your people chased our
ancestors from their lands! Iridi foot soldiers forced entire villages
to flee. If they didn’t leave, a life of darkness and death awaited them
in your mines! Entire families lost! Because of <em>you</em>!” A shower
of words and stones.<br />
    Renzo, burdened with all of the wrongdoings of the Iridi, tore off
the set of traditional Iridi robes, throwing the mass of dark fabric at
the villager’s feet. “I’ve deserted! I’ve got nothing to do with all
that!”<br />
    The traditional robes added a lot of volume to an Iridi, it made
them look imposing and strong, without the added plumage Renzo looked
painfully frail. Renzo hoped this gesture would be enough to convince
them of the legitimacy of this desertion, but the people did not show an
inch of compassion. One of the villagers took some steps forward to spit
on the discarded set of Iridi robes. “A killer without a cloak is still
a killer,” and then proceeded to kick mounds of sand onto it.<br />
    Renzo was afraid. No one would ever accept an Iridi into their
village. There was nowhere to go and returning to the desert meant
certain death. “Please.” Renzo fell on bended knees, that veneer of
composure, gone. “I am nothing. I’ll do whatever you say. I’m yours to
command.” Renzo leant forward then too, face in the dirt. “I am Iri,
lower than low, akin to dirt. I relinquish my name and rights, I am not
worthy of a name.”<br />
    Maka, a well respected citizen of Renate spoke up. “Very well then,
you will live.”     The other villagers whispered amongst themselves.
“But that’s an Iridi!” one said, clutching a stone.<br />
    “Not anymore.” Maka replied, walking up to the despondent Iridi.
“Come.” Maka instructed.<br />
    Renzo insisted on being named Iri. Maka refused, but when the young
Iridi stopped eating in protest the metalworker saw no other option. Iri
wanted this, as penance for the wrongdoings of the people of Irideri.
Maka trained the young Iridi to work metal, while giving regular
teachings of the world Irideri had kept hidden all these annums.
Deprived of chloromyce shroos, the youngling’s grey skin lightened and
became less sensitive, allowing for more time in the suns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    Now with more annums on, Iri could see that this was a way to
repay Maka’s kindness. Iri’s lips were quivering, these foreigners were
not going to leave, they were determined to save Ten.<br />
    “Only one person can open it,” Iri breathed, voice heavy. “Hori, a
puzzle maker perfected the design.” Seeing their faces light up, Iri
finished the thought, “but Hori died.”<br />
    “There must be plans for it somewhere in the city?” Eka asked,
tentatively.<br />
    Iri’s mind was racing. “Plans, yes, it’s possible, but entering the
city is difficult, impossible even.”<br />
    “If the city is so impenetrable, how did you manage to leave it?”
Lupen asked.<br />
    Iri was eyeing the Verido with growing animosity, unaccustomed to
questions.<br />
    “Please.” Eka’s silvery voice broke the silence. “We’ll tell no
one.”<br />
    Iri’s lips curled inwards, remembering that promise to Maka. “There
is a hidden entrance, but you can’t think of going, they’ll catch you
and you’ll have prisms fitted to your heads.”<br />
    “We’ll be alright, Eka’s the muscle and I’m fast on my feet,” Lupen
said.<br />
    “You cannot hope to survive this…” Iri said.<br />
    “What kind of creatures would we be if we allowed Sixteen to die?”
Lupen said.<br />
    The cogs in this Iridi’s heart were thick with rust and getting them
to turn required some effort. “Ridiculous.” Iri said, with much disdain.
“I’ll take you, but that is all.”<br />
    “I’m happy you’re coming with us,” Eka said. “Will the entrance be
guarded, you think?”<br />
    Iri’s throat felt dry and coarse, irritated by the constant stream
of words. Most times the apprentice was alone, working in the dark, with
only tools and metal as companions, they were not great
conversationalists and Iri liked it that way. “Hardly anyone knows about
it, save a handful of guards. I imagine most have forgotten it exists,
there was no real reason for its construction you see, it is unlikely
that my people would have ever undergone a siege.” Iri paused then, eyes
staring at the floor, as if in shame, “only we excel at the art of
savagery.”</p>
<p>They spent the next few days putting convincing Iridi wardrobes
together. If they hoped to go in the city unnoticed, they would have to
look like locals. Maka still had the apprentice’s former robes, Iri had
wanted to bury them but the metalworker knew that this young Iridi would
need them again someday. With the help of a tailor two tents over, they
made two additional robes for Eka and Lupen to wear, using the first as
a model. The townspeople had heard of Iri’s return to Irideri to help a
prisoner and the two strangers, they thought it noble and did their best
to help in any way they could.<br />
    “Silence is highly prized in Irideri. Wearing a scarf is symbolic of
that, and in this particular instance, it will also help to conceal your
foreign features. Iridi now mostly speak the Common Tongue, so you’ll be
fine, but don’t ask too many questions, speak clearly and concisely.”
These last words were for Lupen.<br />
    Lupen stood in full Iridi wear, the blue of the Verido’s face was
somewhat visible, but Iri pulled the hood down further to conceal it.
“Keep it low, always.”<br />
    “I can’t see anything!” Lupen cried, arms flailing.<br />
    Eka laughed, the colour of Red’s eyes were also difficult to hide,
not much could be done to mute their intensity.<br />
    “You will keep your heads down and address no one unless necessary.
If you must talk to someone, again, keep your gaze to the floor. People
will not think it strange, it is a sign of respect. They will accept
this.” Iri explained.<br />
    Then, came Iri’s turn to change into traditional Iridi wear. Wearing
these was difficult now that Iri knew the Iridi’s violent history. The
robes hung heavy on these shoulders, thick with guilt, all of the lives
lost adding to the weight, their blood and anguish woven into the
fabric.<br />
    Iri couldn’t stand it.</p>Continue to <a href='chapter_01.html'>Chapter 1</a>
