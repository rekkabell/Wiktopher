<img src="../media/content/fauna.snakadil.png" />
<p>When the group arrived back in <a href='lexicon.html#renate'>Renate</a>, they stopped at the edge of the city, feet over an invisible grave in the sand. <a href='lexicon.html#renzo'>Renzo</a>, guard of the Court Of Light, had died here. <a href='lexicon.html#lupin'>Lupin</a> and <a href='lexicon.html#eka'>Eka</a> did not know this, but they mirrored their companion. A crowd gathered at the city border then, they moved toward the travelers carrying <a href='lexicon.html#lavendiri'>lavendiri</a> leaves. They tossed the leaves into the air, welcoming them back into the village.</p>

<p><a href='lexicon.html#maka'>Maka</a> pushed through the crowd, rushing over and pulling Renzo into a hug. The metalworker wept. Lupin had sent the woth ahead with a message, a story of the happenings in <a href='lexicon.html#irideri'>Irideri</a>. Maka had begun to cry then already, happy to hear that the lonely apprentice had found peace. Ren laughed. “Not so hard!”</p>

<p>“Hard is all I can do, you know that!” Maka replied, speaking as curtains of tears cascaded onto the front of Ren's robes.</p>

<p>Lupin flashed Eka a smile. “Aaaaall thanks to Mapoleon the <a href='lexicon.html#woth'>woth</a>!” Eka laughed when the woth ignored them, continuing to pick the dust off its wings. "I'm beginning to think it doesn’t want to be named.” Lupin grumbled. "Mapoleon is a great name."

<p>Eka smirked, "woth doesn't agree. Woth wants what woth wants."</p>

<p>"Ma-ma-ma-poleon?" Lupin tried, the woth did not react, it ignored the <a href='lexicon.html#verido'>Verido</a> and returned to its glass ball. "Not a stutterer," Lupin made a mental note of this.</p>

<p>Maka offered a tent to Eka, Lupin and Hush for their stay here in the city. "You are family now," Maka told them, "to me and everyone in Renate." Indeed, they stayed in town a while, and everyday a different villager would come forward to invite them to tea, to play cards at the tavern, or to go on excursions in the canyons. Lupin enjoyed the brief moment of stability, of feeling part of a community again. But soon, a voice whispered at their ear, calling on them to keep going. And so, Eka and Lupin decided to depart, but first, they had to re-supply. Both went around the village to find food and other items for their trip onward.</p>

<p>“Was this really baked this morning?” Eka said, inspecting the loaves of bread produced by the local baker, each one more solid than the next. “Maybe Maka could use this one as an anvil."</p>

<p>The baker continued to knead dough, working up a sweat, Eka wondered if those hands could knead rock into shapes too. “The <a href='lexicon.html#ilk'>Ilk</a> is late, when it arrives we’ll have better stock. In the meantime you’re going to have to make do with what’s left on these shelves. We mix in 50% pebble meal, I've had to cut back on <a href='lexicon.html#teaweet'>teaweet</a> to make sure we can feed the Ilk. Their little group had gone through most of the stores graciously donated by Sovereign <a href='lexicon.html#kurono'>Kurono</a>. The baker watched Eka eyeing the loaves, and smiled. “If you let it rest for 24 hours with ripe <a href='lexicon.html#bonan'>bonans</a>. The moisture will help soften the dough. Then if you soak it in stew, or soup or whatever it'll be easier to chew. It may have less teaweet, but it ain't less healthy. You'll work up a strong jaw eating it!"</p>

<p>Another villager overheard their conversation about the Ilk. “Sometimes Ilk change their route you know, depending on the weather. I just hope it gets here soon. We’re down to bams and kappages, and even THOSE we’re running out of!”</p>

<p>"I thought Renate had loads of fermented kappage always?" Eka said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but none that we can give to transients, yield was bad this year."</p>

<p>Eka nodded. "Understood. Got to feed your own first."</p>

<hr />

<p>Lupin was busy trying to find directions to the next city on their list. They already had a map but it was outdated and needed corrections. Renate housed a cartographer, working from a tent on the northern side of the main tent area. The dwelling was easy to find, as one of its faces bore a map of the tent city. Transients would often gather there if in need of help, all of the merchants were listed on it. It was updated regularly. Lupin visited the tent and was glad to find its occupant there, scratching away at a map that spanned the entire room. Lupin looked at it, and saw the writing atop it saying "<a href='lexicon.html#edonor'>Edonor</a>". The map was very complex, as this was a big city, rivaling <a href='lexicon.html#montore'>Montore</a>. Individual houses weren't identified, but most shops were there. While looking it over, Lupin spotted Nok's workshop, tucked in between a dye artist and a hatter. This was the former workplace of <a href='lexicon.html#orin'>Orin</a>, <a href='lexicon.html#bou'>Bou's</a> <a href='lexicon.html#mapa'>mapa</a>.</p>

<p>"<a href='lexicon.html#nok'>Nok's</a> shop!" Lupin exclaimed, the sudden sound startling the cartographer.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, have you been standing there long?"</p>

<p>"No no," Lupin said, "you're busy, I'll comeback later."</p>

<p>"Busy, yes. I'm always busy. Since I never stop being busy you ought to ask me what you need now, and it'll be up to me to tell you whether or not I can help."</p>

<p>"Oh, well my friend & I are going to Edonor. We need corrections on our map, it's a bit—um, aged. We heard there was a new village between it and Renate."</p>

<p>The cartographer nodded, and then waved a hand, asking for Lupin to come forward. Lupin did just that, approaching slowly, walking over the map and avoiding freshly-painted markings. The Verido unrolled the map and laid it over the floor, going down on hands and knees, mirroring the cartographer's position. "I'm Lupin."</p>

<p>"<a href='lexicon.html#mapoleon'>Mapoleon</a>." the cartographer replied.</p>

<p>Lupin's eyes widened then. "Really? What a coincidence..." It was no coincidence. Earlier that morning, Lupin had passed in front of this very tent and had seen the name. What happened is that the Verido forgot, but the mass of muscle inside this head did not, it thought this combination of letters interesting and put it away for later use.</p>

<p>Mapoleon's eyes were stuck on Lupin's map, hand was already busy correcting mistakes, adding newly-built bridges, danger areas and such. “Didn’t happen to see an Ilk on your way over here have you? It’s late."

<p>"An Ilk is coming here...?" Lupin was sweating now, "um... whi-which one?"</p>

<p>“Ilk of Balandri,” Mapoleon answered, "supposed to arrive soon, we hope.”</p>

<p>Lupin glanced outside through an opening in the wall, heart beating hard, trying to break out from its enclosure. After the corrections, Lupin thanked the cartographer and hurried back over to <a href='lexicon.html#hush'>Hush</a>. Eka wasn’t back yet and Hush was resting, fast asleep in a recess in the ground—a sure way to keep cool. Lupin waited, with eyes on the horizon. Memories of Volare rushed into Lupin's mind, memories of a place this Verido wanted to forget. Just then, Lupin heard people shouting.</p>

<p>“It's here! The Ilk of Balandri is here!”</p>

<p>The Ilk arrived from the south—not its usual path. The whole town was a swirling mess. People amassed empty carts and bags, gathering tools and extra hands, all were getting ready to help unload the Ilk. Lupin noticed a tall ramp, with people running up the steps, getting ready to greet the visitors. This ramp wasn't unfamiliar to Lupin, but these eyes had never seen it from a ground perspective. From down here, the ramp looked frail and unsteady, swaying from side to side as people scaled its numerous steps.</p>

<p>The Ilk arrived at last and came to stand by the platform. Ilk were impressive creatures, skinny, long-legged, giant three-toed feet, long thin faces with a great big set of horns. On their backs, they carried a small Verido town. “The Ilk of Balandri is here!!” The people of the town shouted. Not long after it arrived, caretakers were already preparing bags of teaweet grain to feed it with. Others were busy brushing the sand off its skin, picking rocks from its toes. Other workers pushed steps over to the side of the Ilk, to make a pathway up to the town. People would be coming on and off of it all week.</p>

<p>"This is so exciting!” Eka said to Hush, having just returned to their camping spot in the city. Hush lifted its head to stare up at the Ilk, unimpressed. Next to the <a href='lexicon.html#hyroo'>hyroo</a>, was Lupin, who bore the same disinterested gaze. Hush continued to sleep, but Lupin could not stop watching the Ilk. Eka went to pat Lupin on the head. "Aren't you excited?" But the Verido said nothing.</p>

<p>The quiet town from this morning had turned into a bustling open-air market. Various vendors and store owners from Balandri were setting up shop in a field, previously occupied by masses of tumbling weeds, dry sweet grass, lavendiri bushes and laniva flowers. The place was full of life and colour, people laughing and shouting. Eka took a seat and watched, the market was set up right near their spot. Already, some Balandrians were exploring the city. Like Lupin, they had elongated ears, like delicate flutes of skin, and they all bore colours in their faces, varying in placement and pattern. Balandrians were tattooed with red, rather than blue like those from Volare.</p> 

<p>Eka was glancing from Lupin and back to the people of Balandri. “Dont you want to say hello Lew blue?”

<p>“To what end?”</p>

<p>Eka took Lupin's side. "Suit yourself! Ilk are impressive though aren't they?"

<p>“Nearly 1400 <a href='lexicon.html#mirit'>mirits</a> tall..."</p>

<p>The Voice of the Balandri Ilk was walking through town, Lupin quickly took note of it. They’d never met, but those that bear the title of Voice are easy to recognize, as they all bear a set of robes, unique to the role. For a moment, Lupin wanted to hide, but found that no part of this body wanted to obey. The feet were cemented in sand, the torso heavy, linked to the spot by invisible chains. Although, the arms managed to fight the paralysis, and hurriedly coiled a scarf around Lupin's head, to conceal the markings in part.</p>

<p>Eka gave a loud whistle then, a song that held no secrets to Verido ears.</p>

<p>(....)Si-Re  Re(..) Mi(_._)  ___Fa-Sol(..)</p>

<p>The sound caught the ear of <a href='lexicon.html#klev'>Klev</a>, the <a href='lexicon.html#voice'>Voice</a> of the Balandri Ilk. Klev's eyes turned toward them. Lupin's dumb body could not be persuaded to move, but it was too late now anyway, as the song was a dead giveaway. Klev pushed through the market folk and vendors and arrived at their little camp. By then, Eka had wandered off, to leave them alone together.</p>

<p>“The desert is loud huh?” Klev said, smiling. "You are far from home Volarian." The Balandrian knew Lupin's provenance from the blue ink, but the name was partly concealed. All Klev could make out was 'pin', or 'beetle' in the Common Tongue.</p>

<p>Lupin nodded, shyly. “Yes, though technically that would depend entirely on its whereabouts...” Only those with a birthplace with legs could say this.</p>

<p>“I admire you! I can’t imagine leaving Balandri. It’s very brave to venture out into the unknown like this, you must have seen much of the world."</p>

<p>“I have.” Lupin said, while a confused soup of pride and sadness swished around in this gut. Lupin was happy to have traveled the land and to have met its people, but over time, a hard lump appeared on the side of this head. Whenever thoughts of Volare circulated in this brain, the lump latched onto the memories like a thirsty vampire and gained mass. Then, the simple act of standing on one’s legs became difficult, the weight of it unbearable on Lupin's soul. “Any word of Volare?” Lupin managed to say, a hand massaging the ghostly-protrusion on this skull back down.</p>

<p>Klev's eyes moved to the ground then. “Moving along the Ash plains, last I heard.”</p>

<p>“<a href='lexicon.html#ashplains'>Ash plains</a>?” Lupin said, alarmed. “But that would take them to the <a href='lexicon.html#rupture'>Rupture</a>!"</p>

<p>Klev shared Lupin's concerns. “It’s what I’ve heard. Word is that the Ilk of Volare is um... word is that it's dying. It’s why I had to come and speak to you when I saw you were of Volare. I don't know if you know this, but their Voice died last year. It pains me to be the bearer of so much bad news, but I thought you'd want to know. It's been an emotional year for us all."</p>

<p>Lupin wanted to cry, but was too stunned to produce any expression resembling grief. The Verido's face was eerily devoid of emotion.</p>

<p>"Bala, our Ilk, has been behaving strangely. Bala impart fewer and fewer thoughts these days, it may just be due to grief but I am worried—" Klev continued, in a lower voice. "We're all scared, afraid that both Bala and Oto will follow Vol into the Rupture. If this comes to pass, what does it mean for our people?"</p>

<p>Lupin thought of a conversation with <a href='lexicon.html#rosmus'>Rosmus</a> then...</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>"We rely on half-baked rituals because we are afraid."</i></li>
  <li><i>"Afraid of what?" Lupin asked, but in truth, did not want to know the answer.</i></li>
  <li><i>"That our future is not certain, and that your presence at The Ear doesn't guarantee a thing."</i></li>
</ul>

<p>"Not certain..." Lupin muttered. Then went on to thinking about Mago. <i>What are you doing <a href='lexicon.html#mago'>Mago</a>… why is this happening? Surely you would have found the words to dissuade Vol.</i> "Maybe all of this is my fault..." Lupin said, removing the scarf. "The Voice of Volare isn't dead."</p>

<p>Klev appeared confused, but then read the markings and could see Lupin's name clearly. "Your voice is heavy with grief, and now I know why." The Voice of Balandri put a hand to Lupin's heart, "I am relieved you're alive Lupin, but I don't believe your death was the cause of all this."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Lupin managed to say, fighting back tears.</p>

<p>Klev smiled. "I don't, but believing it will be a burden to you. Put it out of your mind, for now, as it will cloud your judgment and hinder any attempt at meaningful action. Until you know the truth, it is useless to you Lupin."</p>

<p>Lupin nodded, swallowing hard. "You're right." The Verido then too put a hand to Klev's heart. "Thank you. I needed to hear that."</p>

<p>"So what will you do Voice of Volare?"</p>

<p>"Meaningful action."</p>

<p>Lupin did not waste time, parted ways with Klev and went to visit Mapoleon the cartographer once more. "I need whatever update you have for the East road, Ash Plains and all the way to The Rupture." Lupin then spent a good half hour trying to convince Mapoleon to do the work. The cartographer was concerned, desperately trying to convince the Verido not to take The Leap. "I swear to you, I'm not going there to die." Lupin said.</p>

<p>"You'd better, as I do not want to be the one marking the road to it." The cartographer finished adding the desired modifications.</p>

<p>Map in hand, Lupin returned to their encampment then. "Eka!" Lupin began, "change of plans, we're going east to intercept Vol." Eka was draped over Hush, arms laid out over its sides, caressing the large furry beast. "Okay Lew, east we go!" The Verido eyed Eka carefully. "You don't want to know why? Or is it one of those situations where you already know why and that I'm an idiot for asking."</p>

<p>Eka smirked. "You poor tortured soul."</p>

<p>"I'm scared Eka."</p>

<p>Eka had anticipated this sudden shift in mood, and was already halfway to Lupin, coming for a hug. "I know." They stood in each other arms for a long while. "If we walk we'll never make it on time." Lupin said, breaking the silence, eager, and anxious to find a solution. "I think I know how." Eka said.</p>

<p>Eka led Lupin to the northermost edge of the city, where several <a href='lexicon.html#sandfin'>sandfins</a> were moored onto pillings. Hush accompanied them on this trek, and bounded ahead to a carcass of a vessel, laying on it side. Its sails were in tatters, and its hull, dry and punctured. It bore the name "<a href='lexicon.html#tarka'>Tarka</a>" Lupin walked over to it, and climbed into the cabin to assess the damage. "It's not looking too bad! But um — who does it belong to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I know who knows." Eka said, gesturing to another ship moored in the area, a vessel with a red hull bearing the name <a href='lexicon.html#etyl'>Etyl</a>.</p>

<p>"<a href='lexicon.html#nono'>Nono's</a> in town!"</p>

<hr />

<p>They returned to the site that very same night, hoping to find Nono there. Lupin could see someone was in the vessel, a light was on. This resembled that night long ago, when they'd spotted the sandfin in the dark. "Nono's home." The Verido said, relieved.</p>

<p>"KIAO'RI NONO!" Eka shouted.</p> 

<p>They heard lots of noise inside, and then Nono's head came pushing out of one of the portholes. Nono's eyes were healthy this time, and found them in the dark with ease. "Kiao' aikana dii!" Nono shouted, smiling. "Come in! Come in!"</p> 

<p>They all went inside Etyl, with Nono promptly serving everyone oversized mugs of bonan wine. Lupin eyed the tall glass, and was determined to keep Nono from re-filling it once empty, a hard task. Drinking bonan wine was a good way to keep anxiety away though, Lupin thought. Eka threw an arm around Lupin then. "We have time for this okay? Don't worry." Lupin loved hearing Eka say this, because it always turned out to be true.</p>

<p>Nono eyed Hush for a moment, with its head peering inside and the rest seated outside. "Ipaya?" Nono said, offering the hyroo a mug. Hush gave it a lick, but did not enjoy the taste. Nono laughed, and instead served the hyroo a bowl of mashed bams. "Sou mawani te dodon oro!"</p>

<p>"Good for the soul and the stomach you know!" Eka translated. "Looks delicious! Enjoy bud!" Already, Hush's face was buried in the bowl, and licked it all up in a second.</p>

<p>"What brings you here?" Lupin asked Nono.</p>

<p>"Nono deliver teaweet from Montore for Balandri Ilk."</p>

<p>"Oh? Renate villagers asked for extra feed?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no. Teaweet is gift." Nono corrected.</p>

<p>"From who? Why?" Lupin asked, perplexed. People in Montore didn't exude generosity.</p>

<p>"Nono know who, but told no say. But Nono say this, Balandri Ilk visit Montore before come to Renate always, when Ilk late to Montore, they see problem for Renate'wati. This make someone do rare, kind thing."</p>

<p>Lupin laughed. "That's okay, I think I might know who." Despite having little evidence, Lupin knew who was responsible for this generous donation. There weren't many well-endowed philanthropists in Montore. This bit of good news warmed this heart, and the Verido raised a mug-full of bonan wine. "To those who care!"</p>

<p>"To those who care!" They all said again, together.</p>

<p>"Do you know if Tarka belongs to anyone?" Lupin asked Nono then.</p>

<p>Nono thought about the name for a moment. "Iana. Belong to no one, is abandon."</p>

<p>Lupin's eyes lit up then, with the Ilk in town they would have all the parts they needed to repair it. Plus they had metal workers friends they could count on, and a skilled <a href='lexicon.html#sandfinner'>sandfinner</a> to help with the kinks. This was a weight off this Verido's shoulders. They drank their drinks, and Lupin once again failed to catch Nono re-filling their cups. Preventing a <a href='lexicon.html#finiku'>Finiku</a> host from filling your mug was an impossible task, as refusal was seen as modesty. Eka leaned in to Lupin then, "you know, if you don't want to have Nono re-flling your cup, just drink slow." The Verido had much to learn about Finiku drinking etiquette. Lupin did not get sick that night, having eaten enough <a href='lexicon.html#muckwheat'>muckwheat</a> bread and murple bean sausages to soak up the alcohol and lessen its effects.</p>

<p>The next day, they marched over to Ren's tent to ask for help. Ren gladly accepted, and helped to patch up the holes in Tarka's hull. In the meantime, Nono was hard at work mending an old sail. For many years, Nono kept the sail in Etyl's bilge, and as a result was in dire need of repair. "Ora, ora, sail still good. Nono fix it". Lupin and Eka repaired the rudder and mast, but faced a problem when they saw the state of the ropes onboard, the <a href='lexicon.html#hempa'>hempa</a> fibres were worn and brittle and replacing them was necessary. Nono had used up the last of the hempa to repair the sails. Eka asked around town, but found out that Renate suffered a shortage of hempa fibres, even banabo was even difficult to come by this season. Nono quickly intervened. "Hempa is good, but no one here have, and banabo stretch too much." Eka thought for a moment. "What else is good?" Nono looked up at the Ilk then, and Eka followed the Finiku's gaze, "of course!"</p>

<p>Eka told Lupin, who went to ask Klev. Verido did not export <a href='lexicon.html#isilk'>isilk</a> anymore, but would never deny one of their kin. Klev secured enough hair for their project, and again, Nono stepped in to do the work. First, the Finiku cut all hairs the same length and tied the ends together, then divided the bundle into three. Nono's able hands twisted the three sections, holding onto two bundles between fingers, with the third bundle set between toes. Nono began twisting them all in the same direction, as the bundles wrapped around one another it formed a rope. Eka watched the process, and was soon able to replicate the work. They twisted and spliced isilk hairs together all day, whilst Nono sang sandfinner's ballads.</p>

<p>After many days of hard work, came time to test Tark. On the first run, Lupin got the sandfin stuck in a sandbank, on the second, the tiller came loose. The third and fourth run revealed even more problems, but after that they found less and less. On run number 12, the sandfin surfed on the desert plains beautifully, nothing was rattling or threatening to break off. They proceeded to stocking it up with food and supplies for the journey ahead, bags of teaweet flour, crates of <a href='lexicon.html#waterstones'>waterstones</a>, purple kappages, sweet <a href='lexicon.html#bams'>bams</a>, <a href='lexicon.html#mapple'>mapples</a> etc.</p>

<p>On the eve of their departure, they organized a small gathering with friends next to Tarka's mooring spot. Klev told the best Verido jokes, and Ren some <a href='lexicon.html#iridi'>Iridi</a> legends, this paired with Nono’s sandfin stories made for quality entertainment.</p>

<p>Klev presented Lupin and Eka with a bottle of <a href='lexicon.html#kabacho'>kabacho</a>, which they shared with others on the spot. Lupin savoured every gulp. A few shots later, Klev began to play the <a href='lexicon.html#donmol'>donmol</a>, fingers stroking the 4 double strings, creating a tune that only other Verido — or wonders like Eka — could interpret. Lupin smiled, attentive to the lyrics. It was about mountains that could not kneel, moons that could not sleep, and of fires that could not touch. Eka was standing, busy expressing the meaning of the song to the other guests through absurdly exaggerated gestures. Nono and Renzo watched, each mind interpreting the patomime in their own way. "Ara ara! A <a href='lexicon.html#durdle'>durdle</a>! Ora! It is hungry! Also, it no can swim." Nono said. "No, no, it's about the journey of a great warrior!" Renzo corrected.</p>

<p>After the song ended, Nono began reciting a poem about a loose bit of twine on Renzo's pant leg.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bit of twine,</li>
  <li>Many sand it long to see,</li>
  <li>Blade come, too soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the poem, Nono inched forward and cut the bit of twine away with a blade, cackling. Everyone roared with laughter. Nono then proceeded to fill all of the empty mugs with kabacho. "Drink up drink up!" Nono said, tapping the bottom of Lupin's cup, causing some of its content to spill. "I am, I am!" Lupin cried. All in the group were merry, all, but Nono and Eka, they too had consumed the same amount but as usual, it had little effect. "Eka, Nono want to say, Nono stop by <a href='lexicon.html#ministe'>Ministe</a>—” Nono said, turning to Eka. “I talk to woth expert.” The Finiku went on, filling up Eka’s mug again. Experiencing thirst in Nono's presence was impossible, Eka thought, the Finiku was hyperaware, knew the level of liquid present in each mug at all times and insisted that the bottom of the recipient remain unseen. "It bad luck." Nono had said.</p>

<p>“We haven’t found the name of our woth friend yet.” Eka said.</p>

<p>“Nono know Eka find soon,” Nono replied, “Nono tell woth expert about it, giving detail of wingspan, antennae and color. Friend say it super woth! They grow big big!" Saying this, Nono's arms spread wide, spilling half the contents of a mug onto the sand floor, but then, Nono's body relaxed, as another thought came to this mind. "Long long ago, there is more big big thing in desert, and now, not so, not so... is sad. Ilk be the last, maybe. But Nono think, maybe not so, because when Nono young, Nono see big big creature. Nono remember well." Saying this, Nono's eyes glassed over. "Nono si mawani de kira te'sawa."</p>

<p>Renzo overheard the last bit of their conversation, and eyed Nono carefully then. "You saw the soul of the sun and the wind?"</p>

<p>Nono had drifted to another place entirely, recalling something that had happened years ago. Nono began to tell the story, switching to Finic, speaking in a low voice so Eka could translate to the others. Eka got the message, and began to share Nono's tale...</p>

<p>"When I was a sproutling, I walked to the Rupture with my mapa and my grand-mapa Etyl. The ground was covered in ash, it made my feet black, but I was not scared because I wasn't alone. Together we walked to the edge of the precipice, hugged and said goodbye, and then without a word, I watched my grand-mapa leap into the hole, and disappear into the dark, swallowed up whole. We stayed for the night, but I could not sleep. Images of my grand-mapa falling kept coming to mind. I got up, and went to stand on the edge of the Rupture again. I don't know what I was expecting to see, I knew my grand-mapa would not be there, but I found comfort in knowing she was near. But then, I saw a giant figure, a large robe and long legs passed over my head. In passing, its robe swept up swirling clouds of ash. The ash stained my clothes and skin, and obstructed my vision for a moment. I cleared it away from my eyes, and saw the giant climb down into the depths, ash clouds licking at its body. Then it was gone.” Eka said, stopping as Nono took a breath. All were listening, gathered around the fire and enthralled by Nono's story.</p>

<p>"I've heard a similar story," Klev said. "My friend Uggi was up late one night, observing the reflection of the moons on the dunes below. Uggi saw a tall shape in the distance, moving. Its legs spanned entire dunes. Uggi went to grab a glass to see its features more closely, but then it bent down and Uggi lost sight of it."</p>

<p>Renzo also had a story to share. "I've spent the greater part of my life in a walled-city, like you Klev, I did not see one with my own eyes, but I heard stories. During the raids at the <a href='lexicon.html#suvalbasanctuary'>Suvalba Sanctuary</a>, soldiers stole seeds to bring back to Moera. As you know, Iridi have little tolerance for light, and so the soldiers slept in the day and traleved at night. One day, all awoke to the blood-curdling screams of a soldier. The soldier was shaking, claiming to have seen some kind of giant apparition wandering in the camp. No one else had seen it, and so they ignored it. On another day they saw <a href='lexicon.html#leafhound'>leafhounds</a> trailing far behind them, following them loosely. Again, they ignored it. They arrived in <a href='lexicon.html#irideri'>Irideri</a>, and noticed then that their bags had holes in them. They'd lost much of their seed cargo on the way here. They lied about it, of course... no one wanted to suffer <a href='lexicon.html#moera'>Moera's</a> wrath." Renzo smiled, "soldiers would never admit to it, they're too proud, but many thought that someone had pierced the bags in the night, and that the leafhounds trailed behind to gather up the seeds. It's a story passed between soldiers, in their old age they became less reluctant to share it. Made it to my ears later. I wonder where those seeds are now."</p>

<p>Lupin couldn't believe it. The raid on the sanctuary was a horrible event, Zucca had saved many lives that day, and would be glad to know that someone else, a giant, some apparition, had saved many more.</p>

<p>The night ended with everyone sleeping around a dying flame, all, but Lupin and Eka. Both were lying next to each other, gazing up at the night sky. A question burned at Lupin's lips. “You didn’t look surprised when you saw me at the top of the mountain.”

<p>“Surprised? No. Happy? Yes.” Eka said with a kind smile.</p>

<p>“If not me… then someone else?” Lupin said, feeling small and unimportant.</p>

<p>“No. Couldn’t have been anyone else. Couldn’t have happened any other way,” Eka said, rolling over and throwing an arm around Lupin's middle. “Others have come before you, but you weren’t born then so you have a good excuse.” Eka said with a smirk.

<p>“You’re getting real tall,” Lupin noted.</p>

<p>"You noticed that huh?"</p>

<p>"When I met Uno, it was difficult to have a conversation. Uno was always sort of... detached. Mind was elsewhere. Is that what will happen to you?"</p>

<p>The wonder said nothing but pulled Lupin in close, until they were cheek to cheek, belly to belly. Lupin's eyes locked onto the skyrocks above. “Why aren’t you together?” Eka was drawing invisible picture on Lupin's back, smirking. “You could ask the same of the Ilk."</p>

<p>"They used to be together," Lupin began, "but then they agreed to help us."</p>

<p>"You've got your answer, I think." Eka said.</p>

<p>Lupin gazed up at the moons then. "I wish I could live forever."</p>

<p>"A good life is better than a long one Lew, and the 'goodness of life' can't be determined by its length."</p>

<p>The woth crawled out of its glass ball and flew onto Eka's head. When it settled, Eka began to stroke the ends of the hairs on its back, humming. The sound put both Lupin and the woth to sleep.</p>

</hr>

<p>The next morning, Lupin woke to the sound of arguing. Nono was awake, standing at the foot of a <a href='lexicon.html#beobug'>Beobug</a> sandfin that had come to moor here in the night. The vessel had kinked Nono's vessel in the process, an 'accident' that Nono believed was deliberate. Nono was swearing aloud in <a href='lexicon.html#finic'>Finic</a>.</p>

<p>Lupin walked up to Nono to stare at the vessel, then looked up and noticed <a href='lexicon.html#gree'>Gree</a> at one of the portholes. Lupin whistled, "HEY! Come down, that's hardly respectable! Hiding like that!"</p>

<p>"Hide?!" Gree shouted, exiting the sandfin in a huff, ready to smack whoever had said this but then, noticed who it was. "Araaa! Voice of Volare! An honor!"

<p>"Stop right there—" Lupin said, "did you wreck Etyl on purpose?"</p>

<p>"No no no no—" Gree said, in a Nono kind of way.</p>

<p>Nono's skin reddened at this, and jumped onto Gree's back, pulling the Finiku's ears and screaming into them ."NAIBAKA DI!" Gree was running in circles, unable to dislodge this angry passenger. "Gree wreck Etyl so Nono captain Beobug ship!!"</p>

<p>"No no I would never do this!" Gree yelled, struggling to pry Nono off. Nono was the strongest of the two, with legs hugging Gree's middle and hands tugging at the Finiku's ears, like one would pull on carriage reins.</p>

<p>"Iana! Gree always lie!" Nono then proceeded to ruffle up Gree's hair, and then grabbed onto the nose of the victim, a finger pulling at each nostril. Gree's eyes started to water then. "IAAA—! NONO IANA!"</p>

<p>Lupin was tempted to separate them but found it all too amusing, and thought Gree deserved it.</p>

<p>"OKAY OKAY!" Gree shouted then. "Is no mistake, BeobugII bump into Etyl."

<p>Lupin sighed. "Why did you do that?"

<p>Nono let go, slipped off and moved to stand next to Lupin, eyes thin and angry. "It because Gree be fiend."</p>

<p>Gree's face turned red and puffy then, hands curled into tight fists. "IANA is lie this! You no understand Gree at all!" The Finiku's face returned to its normal shade. "Nono is talented sandfinner, have talent that I no have. I get Beobug job to impress Nono."</p>

<p>"What a lie, this!" Nono said, angry.</p>

<p>Gree looked even more sad then, ears dropping. "It be no lie. What if Gree agree to listen to you?"</p>

<p>Nono laughed, but Gree insisted that it was the truth. Nono had an idea then. "Okay. Then abandon Beobug job, go home to mapa to say truth about Nono."</p>

<p>Lupin's eyes widened then. "Is Gree... your sibling?" Lupin did remember Gree saying that they'd been grown on the same plot of land. Nono nodded. "Ora. Gree and Nono grow together. More than this, the stem of Gree wrap around Nono, like <a href='lexicon.html#snakadil'>snakadil</a>! Gree suffocate Nono already then. Even now, Gree never stop to try to smother Nono."</p>

<p>Gree was fidgetting nervously. "Gree was a seedling Nono...! Truth is Nono always reject Gree, most time, many time for no reason!"</p>

<p>Nono did not care. "Even as seed, already then Nono want nothing to do with Gree. Gree have rot inside."</p>

<p>Lupin remembered what <a href='lexicon.html#zucca'>Zucca</a> had said about seedlings in the ground, how they developed links to one another, and the sadness of one could affect its neighbour. Since both had grown together, linked-up, they had developed a bond unlike any other. Gree depended on Nono, more than Gree cared to admit, and Nono instinctively wanted to get away after being trapped early in life. Nono's revulsion of Gree was sown early.</p>

<p>"How about you two sandfin together?" Lupin suggested.</p>

<p>"Lupin crazy. Nono no work for Beobug fiendling." Nono said, disgusted with the idea.</p>

<p>"—Aboard Etyl."</p>

<p>Gree looked at Nono, "but if Gree did this, it leave BeobugII without captain..."</p>

<p>"Ara, ara, Gree need no worry. Beobug find other captain <i>easy</i>. Gree have no talent."</p>

<p>"So it's decided then! You'll travel together from now on." Lupin said.</p>

<p>Nono realized what Lupin had said just then. "No no no no no—" but before Nono could no-no any further, Lupin let out a whistle, as loud as anyone had ever heard. Even the Ilk of Balandri turned its head to look. It silenced Nono, a whistle like that commanded respect.</p>

<p>Gree nodded. "Ora Lupin, wala agree."</p>

<p>"Iana. This no fair for Nono. Is bad bad bad idea."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's time to-revisit those feelings. It sounds like you never really gave Gree a chance. You are family, and family, like community, is important. It's um— it's everything..." Saying this, Lupin started to cry. Lupin went to sit on the ground, body shaking, overcome with grief. The Verido was inconsolable.</p>

<p>Gree stared, uncomprehending. Nono too, was puzzled by this sudden reaction. "Ara ara—" Nono said, in a gentle voice, "Gree and Nono travel together. Nono be patient. Nono promise." Gree was about to wear the Beobug cap but Nono slapped it away. Both Finiku continued to bicker, but more quietly this time. They talked about how to cohabit on Etyl.</p>

<p>Lupin was on the ground still, unable to calm down. This is when Klev stepped in, the Voice of Balandri went to sit next to Lupin. The Balandrian held Lupin close, and began to whistle in ilken as a way to quiet Lupin's heart. "I have to go home." Lupin managed to say. "You are, Tarka is ready." Klev said.</p>

<p>"Even if Vol doesn't die, there is no place for me in Volare, not anymore."</p>

<p>"The balance yes, I know, but sometimes, we have to look past sacrifice and politics. Especially in times like this, I think your city needs you."</p>

<p>Lupin raised a head, glancing at the Ilk of Balandri. "They'll think I betrayed them..."</p>

<p>"You fell," Klev said, "how is that a betrayal?"</p>

<p>"I never tried to tell them that I was alive. I could have done this but I didn't, I instead chose to let them sit with the pain of my death. I never wanted to be Voice, maybe I did fall on purpose..."</p>

<p>"Your reasons are your own Lupin, they love and respect you, they'll understand why you did what you did¸" Klev said, "maybe you were meant to fall, meant to come here, to meet Eka, to learn about the world. If what I think is happening with the Ilk IS happening, we'll need someone like you to help us adapt to life in the dust. I dont like to think about it, in fact, I've been land-sick all day."</p>

<p>"I'd be a bad teacher," Lupin said, but then began to think back on everything that had happened, and a different picture began to form in this head. Lupin was strong, resilient, understanding and caring. These were the qualities of a teacher, of a good teacher. "Okay." Lupin said then. "Okay" Lupin said again, standing up. The Verido looked up at Bala, and began whistling to the Ilk. The Ilk of Balandri was eating teaweet and stopped in mid-chew to listen. After the whistling was over, Bala swallowed, turned its head downwind, and then took a deep breath, its sides and throat bulging. A low, deep sound pushed out of its throat, reverberating through the town and across the desert plains. As it sang, the whole town stopped to listen, even if they could not understand its meaning.</p>

<p>Klev listened to the message, and smiled. "They will be happy to hear you're alive."</p>

<p>Lupin nodded, "Yes, I think so..."</p>Continue to <a href='chapter_01.html'>Chapter 1</a>
