<p><b>2023.08.19. Note</b>. Finished the initial pass of corrections for the entire text. Because things have changed a lot, I've decided to once again remove the text here. The first chapter is going to be very different, so figured it didn't make sense to keep it here. Apologize, making a book is a messy affair.</p>
