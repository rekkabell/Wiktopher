<blockquote>
<p><em>A type of fungus that emits strong phosphorescent light, it grows
in caves, underground where there is no light. It is an object of desire
for the Iridi, who have fought wars in its name.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Irideri,” Eka said, “home of the Iridi! That’s where we’re going
next. The monks there make the <em>best</em> chloromyce shroo noodles.
They glow in the dark! Plus if you eat too much the soles of your feet
become iridescent.”<br />
    “Monks who make noodles?” Lupen said, while caressing the spot
between Hush’s ears, who had carried them much distance and now demanded
payment in the form of a head massage.<br />
    “Oh yes! At the end of every annum, Iridi monks go deep underground,
into the chasms of the Andenuis and spend ten days there, alone,
meditating. When they emerge, they prepare the noodles to celebrate the
new annum. It symbolizes a renewal of the self, a shedding of your old
skin kind of thing.”<br />
    “Alone? In the dark? For a ten days? Oh no no no, I could
<em>never</em> do that. I mean, it’s scary isn’t it? You’re in the dark,
there’s no one around to talk to, or to touch you. It’s like you’re not
really there.” Lupen said, swallowing hard. “If I don’t feel or see
anything, how do I know I exist?”<br />
    “Oh, precious Lu. If you’re thinking that you’re nothing, you are
something. You are a <em>thinking thing</em>.”<br />
    The Verido made a face, processing the words, “I’m a thinking thing.
Thinking things are not nothing.” A reassured smile formed on Lupen’s
lips. “Having iridescent feet would be fun. I still don’t want to go
meditating in a cave alone though, I hope that’s not required to eat
chloromyce noodles.”<br />
    “We shall see!” Eka said, tearing away from Lupen for a moment and
reaching into Hush’s saddle bag for a book bound by banabo thread with
silvery writing on top. “This book is going to tell us everything we
need to know about Irideri.”<br />
    “Where d’you get that book?” Lupen asked, having no memory of it
ever being around until now.<br />
    “Borrowed it from the Alkarawin library in Montore.” Eka said.<br />
    “How are we going to return it? I’ve got no plans to go to Montore
again… couldn’t even if I wanted to.”<br />
    “I’ll woth it back.” Eka said, smiling at the woth, asleep in the
glass ball on Lupen’s belt.<br />
    “Is that something people say? ‘I will <em>woth</em> this letter to
you?’” Lupen asked.<br />
    “It’s something I say, and that others ought to say.” Eka said,
showing Lupen the cover of the book, it read <em>Habitants of the
Dark</em>.<br />
    “I had a long talk with Zucca about the Iridi, they ruined a lot of
lives. They raided all those villages for workers, destroyed the Suvalba
sanctuary, all that because they didn’t want to harvest the chloromyce
shroos themselves. It’s horrible. Why are they so dependent on them
anyway?”<br />
    “That’s because of The Luminary, Moera, the first ever Sovereign of
Irideri. Moera loved the stuff.” Eka opened the book and began to turn
the first few pages. It was an old tome, the pages, like the binding
thread, were also made from banabo fibers. “I’m going to read the story
out loud! I’ll make voices and everything.”<br />
    “I don’t care to hear it, I already know how it ends.” Lupen
said.<br />
    “Shush, shush, this is not for you, this is for Hush and Wormple the
Woth.” Eka said. The woth stirred inside its glass ball, but did not
rise to the name Wormple. Eka flashed Lupen a smile and began to read
aloud…</p>

<h3 id="habitants-of-the-dark">Habitants of the Dark</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>     Moera rose to power in the early days and united the five
villages built inside the protective ridge belt of the Andenuis. These
villages were combined and named Irideri. Under the order of Moera, the
townspeople spent ha’annums[^] digging at the mountain side, they built
foundries, to make the tools necessary to erect a beautiful walled city,
worthy of their ruler. The Iridi people lived in the light in those
days, but everything changed when they found chloromyce shroo in the
underground caves.<br />
     Moera was enthralled by their beauty. The Sovereign called upon the
best artisan in the city and asked that the chloromyce be embedded into
jewlery.<br />
     Moera was having tea under the high midday suns when the artisan
presented the gift of the crystalized shroo, wrapped in a silvery cloth
adorned with a bright yellow ribbon. Moera undid the ribbon, but once
presented to the suns the shroo exploded in a thick cloud of spores, the
spores entered the Sovereign’s eyes, rendering Moera blind.<br />
     The chloromyce shroos, the kingdom learned, could not be exposed to
daylight. On that day, Moera declared that the suns were a menace and
decreed that all should seek the light of the chloromyce shroos
instead.<br />
     The residents of Irideri began to sleep in the daytime, living in
the dark. The only light present was the one emitted by the glow of the
chloromyce shroos.<br />
     The Crown began to ingest chloromyce shroo powder, with the belief
that in time these eyes would be healed. Eventually, the custom spread
through the village, where people mirrored the actions of their Monarch.
Ingesting chloromyce shroo powder permitted them to live healthy lives
in perfect darkness, and their vision too adapted to the low light.
Fresh shroo spores were dangerous, it is why Iridi people kept them in
closed, glass balls, but when dried they lost their irritative
qualities.<br />
     Overtime, Moera developed a sensitivy to loud noises. A servant
could be executed for dropping a spoon on the ground. From that moment
on, all citizens of Irideri left their shoes at the entrance to the
palace and walked barefoot inside. This practice of silence was widely
adopted. The entire kingdom learned to make as little sound as possible,
they kept their voices low.<br />
     When Moera left this world, the heir to the throne, Bao The Bright,
assumed the role of Light of Lights. The army was disbanded, the mining
sites outside of the city were shut, and the kingdom of Irideri shut its
doors to all foreign visitors.<br />
     Ingesting chloromyce shroos made the habitants of Irideri sensitive
to light, causing mild phototoxicity, strengthening their hatred of the
suns. Over just two generations, their skin greyed and their eyes
darkened. Such is the story of the Iridi, the habitants of the dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>                                            ~</p>
<p>    Eka read on. “They see clearly in the dark. It says here that the
chloromyce shroos speak to them, they see words and colours in
them!”<br />
    Lupen laughed. “I can see words and colours too, all I have to do is
eat some bad herbs…”<br />
    “Ah! So you <em>did</em> listen!” Eka said. “I bet you’ll be
impressed with the Iridi once you see the city. Well, if we get to see
it. It’s hard to get inside I’ve heard.” They could already make out the
shape of the mountain in the distance. The second sun was setting,
leaving room for the moons and stars to shine. “Things have to be
different now.”<br />
    “I hope you’re right.” Lupen wanted to believe that the Iridi had
abandoned their former ways. “Second sun is coming down, let’s set up
camp.”</p>
<p>As the second sun fell over the horizon, the people of Irideri were
waking. The kingdom slept during the day and came alive at dusk. In the
palace, Kurono, the Young Light of the realm, was already out of bed.
Kurono wore dark robes that shimmered in the light of the chloromyce
shroos. Part of Kurono’s hair was sculpted into a bun, held up by silver
wiring and adorned with colourless jewels, the rest was down and stopped
short of touching the floor.<br />
    Hair arrangement, as well as clothing, was important in Irideri.
Your outer facade was a reflection of your inner self. Untidy hair
communicated that you have no discipline, that your thoughts are
cluttered, but having a well-sculpted head of hair is a sign that your
life is in perfect order.<br />
    Iri was helping the Young Crown get ready. The servant’s face was
covered by a mask from the nose down, which was a symbol of silence, of
servitude, a reminder to others that Iri were not allowed to speak.
Servant-wear was simple, with little skin visible, aside from the eyes
and forehead. They had no eyebrows, no discerning physical traits or
means of producing an expression.<br />
    Iri always had a tall silver rod in hand, topped with a T shape.
Dangling from one branch was a glass ball, and in it, a glowing
chloromyce shroo. In public, Iri shadowed Kurono and made sure that the
Monarch-To-Be was never unlit. Most of the kingdom was kept dark, making
the presence of a royal in the room the centre of attention.<br />
    “Playroom Iri.” The Young Light said with a sigh, knowing that being
in a room designed for play without a playmate wouldn’t be much fun at
all. There wasn’t anyone around to play with. Iri was a good servant,
but a poor playmate because all who served Irideri could not talk unless
spoken to. Iri had even fewer privileges, they couldn’t eat, sleep,
walk, or move without Kurono saying so. All servants of the Light shared
a single name: Iri.<br />
    Today, nothing amused Kurono, not even the large collection of
puzzles filling the room. These contraptions had been more friend than
any living person, but all had been solved and held no more
secrets.<br />
    “Will you dance with me Iri?” the Young Light asked suddenly.<br />
    Kurono spoke to Iri often, having an ear to talk to with a mouth
bound by law meant that anything could be said without fear of
punishment.<br />
    Iri flashed an open hand then, which meant: Have no illusions about
me. I am not worthy of language. I am nothing.<br />
    “Would you deny a request by your crown-to-be?” Kurono asked with a
smile. “Dance me with <em>now</em>, I demand it!” The Little Light stood
up and went to take the servant’s hands. Iri could not refuse.<br />
    Kurono lead the confused Iri into a waltz. “Do as I do.” Iri
followed Kurono’s steps well enough. After a while it was difficult to
tell that this Iri had never before danced a waltz. Iri had been part of
Kurono’s life for a long time and knew many things, like how this Young
Light enjoyed overcooked peagram dumplings, and the smell of Montimori
flowers.<br />
    “I’ve been thinking about this a lot,” the Young Crown began,
“you’ve never given me any gifts on any of my past Green Days. I am
<em>very</em> upset about that.”<br />
    Iri began to sweat, upsetting Kurono was punishable by death.<br />
    “Don’t worry! I know what I want you to give me,” both stopped
dancing then, but Kurono kept hold of the servant’s hand. “I want…no, I
<em>need</em> to hear your voice.”<br />
    Iri appeared calm, but the organs inside were all twisted up into
knots. With every breath came great pain. Once again, an open hand came
to pass in front of the servant’s face to mean: I am nothing.<br />
    “I know I’m asking a <em>lot</em>, but I promise you I won’t tell.
You’re the only friend I’ve got, and I’m sick of doing all the talking.
No one here listens to me, but you do! Surely, there are some beautiful,
unique thoughts in that head of yours. I want to know what they are. I
want to know <em>you</em>.”<br />
    The servant motioned with a hand: I am nothing.<br />
    “I’m <em>ordering</em> you to speak to me Iri.” The Crown-To-Be
demanded, with mounting irritation.<br />
    Iri was conflicted. The rules of the realm forbade servants of the
Light to speak, but the Young Crown demanded it. The purpose of an Iri
was to do what was asked, but doing it meant breaking another rule.
Rules would be broken either way. Making a decision was
impossible.<br />
    Irritated by this silence, the Young Light moved forward and tore
the mask covering Iri’s mouth. Kurono hated silence and rules, perhaps
now with it gone Iri would speak.<br />
    Even without the presence of that physical barrier, the servant’s
lips produced no sound. The servant followed the laws of Irideri. Now,
with lips unmasked, Kurono could see the Iri mouthing the words. I am
nothing. I am nothing.<br />
    Kurono’s teacher Mura came at the door then, but could not enter,
the door had been locked from the inside. “Young One! It is time for
your history lesson!”<br />
    Kurono stuck a tongue out at the closed door. “I don’t want to! Go
away!” Then, went on to pinch Iri’s nose, “you’re going to have to open
your mouth to breathe sometime!” Iri’s mouth remained shut and the face
contouring it turned a deep shade of blue.<br />
    Mura was in the hall still, muttering behind the closed door. “Our
Brightest will <em>not</em> be pleased with you Young Light!”<br />
    “I don’t care!” Kurono yelled, eyes fixed on Iri’s face, watching it
turn a deep and unsightly purple colour. “You’re not going to die like
<em>this</em> are you?”<br />
    Iri had no death wish, this one could not serve Kurono, or the realm
if dead. The servant’s mouth opened, and Iri took a deep breath.<br />
    Kurono gasped. Iri had no tongue. Back in the old days, those who
knew things the Crown deemed unsavoury had their tongues and vocal cords
cut out. Kurono thought that this custom was long gone, the previous
monarch thought it was too barbaric. The Young Crown’s eyes moved to
Iri’s neck and spied a number hidden under the collar, the number “10”
written in flesh. “10? What is <em>this</em>?”<br />
    Iri hurriedly pressed a finger to the Young Light’s lips with a low,
“shush!”<br />
    Kurono had never seen Iri behave like this. The servant’s face was
warped by fear. For the first time there was a display of personality
coming from this Iri, something that had long been hidden away.<br />
    When Kurono tried to speak again, Iri put a whole hand over the
Young Crown’s mouth. They locked eyes, both were shocked at what was
happening. Kurono did not try to stop Iri.<br />
    Mura’s voice resounded in the hallway once again. “I am
<em>very</em> upset with you Kurono. Now, where is that key…”<br />
    Iri panicked at the thought of having touched the Little Light
without permission. Hearing the sound of the teacher fiddling with the
door lock, Iri tore the mask from Kurono’s hands and put it back
on.<br />
    The door opened with Mura looking very displeased. “I will not ask
again. Iri, walk Kurono to the study hall”. Mura left, leaving them
alone again.<br />
    Iri walked to the door, and Kurono followed the servant to the study
hall, all the while staring at Iri’s neck and thinking of the number
inscribed onto it, wondering what it meant and why it was there.</p>
<p>Focusing on today’s lessons was impossible. The number 10 was
emblazoned in the Young Light’s mind. 10. 10 what…? Kurono
wondered.<br />
    After a while, Kurono’s brain conjured up images of 10 tiny workers
at the crook of Mura’s nose, getting ready to go on an expedition inside
the left nostril. The teacher did not fail to notice that the student
wasn’t listening. After the lesson, they went to inform Demeri. Telling
Demeri was not done out of concern for the young student, but to make
clear that this was not their fault.<br />
    After Kurono’s lesson, the Light Of The Realm, Demeri, came to the
study hall. Demeri was tall, made taller by an elaborate vertical
diadem. The diadem kept the Light’s hairdo together, pinned in the
centre, like the knot of a giant bow. “Kurono, light of my life, what is
the matter?” Demeri was followed by many servants, careful to keep the
monarch well-lit. The light shone on the robes, reflecting off the
layers of dark fabric, fanning out in all directions, like the petals of
a flower.<br />
    “Your teacher tells me you had trouble focusing today. You must tell
me if you need a replacement. There is no play of light that can rightly
conceal Mura’s growing collection of wrinkles, it’s dreadful.”<br />
    “Isn’t it true that Bao The Bright forbade the cutting of tongues?”
Kurono asked suddenly.<br />
    Demeri, surprised, glanced at the Iri before giving a reply. “Is
this what Mura has been teaching you?”<br />
    Iri looked tense, in pain, as if burned by fire.<br />
    “My Iri has a number. 10, it says,” Kurono continued, sitting
upright in the chair to appear more confident, “why?”<br />
    The Light of the Realm stood up. “Enji, take Kurono back to the
playroom.”<br />
    Kurono wanted to scream. Enji accompanied the Young Light out of the
study hall. Iri followed, but before the servant could step out, Demeri
shouted another order. “You stay here Iri.”<br />
    Kurono’s misbehavings were often the cause of Iri’s time spent in
rehabilitation. Everytime the Young Light complained of the Iri, it
resulted in what was commonly referred to as ‘rehabilitation’. Iri
always reemerged transformed. Kurono was always happy to have Iri back,
with things being as they were before. But this time felt different.
Kurono was scared.<br />
    “No! It was my fault! Don’t do this!”<br />
    Enji shut the door and forced Kurono back into the playroom, as
requested. “You have to stay here Young One, the Brightest In The Realm
commands it,” the guard said, before locking the door from the
outside.<br />
    “Don’t hurt Iri, please! It was <em>my</em> fault!” Kurono cried
through the thick of the door.<br />
    There was some silence, then Enji spoke. “This is not the first time
Iri goes to rehabilitation Young Light, don’t worry. A servant will be
returned to you shortly.”<br />
    Kurono listened to Enji’s footsteps. They grew fainter and fainter,
until all sound and echo quieted.<br />
    <em>A</em> servant.<br />
    The way Enji phrased it stuck in Kurono’s mind…</p>
<p>The next day Iri was not there to brush Kurono’s hair. One of
Demeri’s servants came to do it instead and answered no questions.
Fortunately at breakfast, Iri stood at the door, unharmed, like all
those other times after returning from rehabilitation.<br />
    Demeri was sitting in front of a small table, covered with a dark
cloth. On the table lay a simple breakfast of mugiko porridge and fresh
nukaberries. The meal was served in dark earthenware that sparkled under
the light of the chloromyce shroos. A servant was pounding an ear of
dried chloromyce shroo into a powder using a large pestle and mortar.
Once the shroos were pulverized the servant took the pestle away from
the bowl, bowed and backed out of the room. As soon as a servant left,
another walked in to transfer the powder into a shallow bowl using a
thin banabo scoop. The servant then set the serving bowl on the table
along with the breakfast. A long line of servants stood outside, each
holding a different tool, waiting for their turn. Each Iri was good at
doing one thing, and they practiced this one skill everyday. Each action
took the same time, and used the same number of moves, choreographed to
perfection.<br />
    “10,” the Sovereign began, “is a marker given to some of our
workers. That is all.”     “You didn’t like that I asked.” Kurono
said.<br />
    Monarch Demeri dipped 2 spoonfuls of powdered chloromyce shroo
powder into a cup of warm water, then proceeded to gently stir it into
the drink, drawing a swirl of light. “I did not like your tone
Kurono.”<br />
    “And the tongues?” Kurono insisted.<br />
    “What about them?” Demeri asked, taking a sip of chloromyce-infused
tea.<br />
    “Iri has no tongue. I thought Bao The Bright had made that practice
illegal.”<br />
    “If I hear that name one more time I shall erase it from the history
books.”<br />
    Kurono took a sip of tea as well, thinking hard, trying to find ways
to get some answers without angering Demeri.</p>
<p>Number 10 went back to having a lackluster persona, muted, without
worry or fear. This worried Kurono. The Young Light was suspicious, and
so that morning when the servant was asleep Kurono went to look for the
number on the Iri’s neck. The number on the skin had changed to 11. This
was not the same Iri.<br />
    Kurono knew the ugly truth. Every complaint about an Iri resulted in
an exchange. Iri would go to rehabilitation and be replaced by another
with a new number carved onto its neck. Kurono did not want to think
about what happened to an Iri in rehabilitation, were they sent back in
the mines? Were they tortured? Killed?     “What have I done…” The Young
Light whispered. Kurono remembered sending an Iri to rehabilitation for
breathing too loud, for walking too funny, for blinking too often, and
sometimes Kurono asked Iri to be sent away out of boredom. Kurono felt
like a fiend. “10 lives…” After that, no complaint was made of 11, in
fear that this Iri too would be harmed. Going to Demeri for answers was
impossible. Kurono felt more lonely than ever, with no one to confide
in, with no way to know what had really happened to Iri number 10.</p>
