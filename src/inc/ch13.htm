<h1>The Ilk town of Balandri</h1>
<h2>— Chapter 13 —</h2>
<img src="../media/content/flora.conk.shroo.jpg" />
<p>When the group arrived back in Renate, Renzo stopped at the edge of the city, feet over an invisible grave in the sand. This is where the Guard from the Court of Light died. A crowd gathered at the city border, they moved toward the travelers, flowers in hand, instead of stones. They tossed the petals into the air, welcoming their friend back into their lives.</p>

<p>Maka pushed through the crowd, rushing over and pulling Renzo into a hug. The metalworker wept. Lupin had sent the woth ahead with a message, a story of the happenings in Irideri. Maka had begun to cry then already, happy to hear that the lonely apprentice had found peace. Ren laughed. “Not so hard!”</p>

<p>“Hard is all I can do! You know this.” Maka replied, speaking as curtains of tears cascaded onto the front of Ren's robes.</p>

<p>Lupin flashed Eka a smile. “Aaaaall thanks to Mapoleon the woth!” Eka sniggered when the woth ignored them, continuing to clean the dust off its wings. "I'm beginning to think it doesn’t want to be named.” Lupin grumbled. "Mapoleon is a great name."

<p>Eka smirked, "woth doesn't agree."</p>

<p>"Ma-ma-ma-poleon?" Lupin tried, the woth did not react, it ignored the Verido and returned to its glass ball. "Not a stutterer," Lupin made a mental note of this.</p>

<p>Maka offered a tent to Eka, Lupin and Hush for their stay here in the city. "You are family now," Maka told them, "to me and everyone in Renate." Indeed, they stayed in town a while, and everyday a different villager would come forward to invite them to tea, to play cards at the tavern, or on excursions in the canyons. Lupin enjoyed the brief moment of stability, of feeling part of a community again. But soon, a voice whispered at their ear, calling on them to keep going.</p>

<p>And so, Eka and Lupin decided to depart, but first, they had to re-supply. Both went around the village to find food and other items for their trip onward.</p>

<p>“Was this really baked this morning?” Eka said, inspecting the loaves of bread produced by the local baker, each one more solid than the next. “This one I could use to hammer down nails."</p>

<p>The baker continued to knead dough, working up a sweat—perhaps they could knead rock into shapes too. “The Ilk was supposed to have arrived days ago, when it comes we’ll have better stock. In the meantime you’re going to have to make do with what’s left on these shelves. We mix in 50% pebble meal. We need to cut back on teaweet to make sure we can feed the Ilk when it arrives”.

<p>The group had gone through most of the stores Sovereign Kurono had given them, there was little choice but to take what was available here. “If you let it rest for 24 hours with ripe bonans. The moisture will help soften the dough," the baker suggested.

<p>"That's a good tip, thanks!" Eka said.</p>

<p>Another villager overheard their conversation about the Ilk. “Sometimes Ilk change their route you know, depending on the weather. I just hope it gets here soon. We’re down to bams and kappages, and even THOSE we’re running out of!”</p>

<p>"I thought Renate had loads of fermented kappage always?" Eka said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but none that we can give to transients, yield was bad this year."</p>

<p>Eka nodded. "Understood. Got to feed your own first."</p>

<hr />

<p>Lupin was busy trying to find directions to the next city on their list. They already had a map but it was outdated and needed corrections. Renate housed a cartographer, working from a tent on the northern side of the camp. The dwelling was easy to find, as one of its faces bore a map of the tent city. Transients would often gather there if in need of help, all of the merchants were listed on it. It was updated regularly. Lupin visited the tent and was glad to find its occupant there, scratching away at a map that spanned the entire room. Lupin looked at it, and saw the writing atop it saying "Edonor". The map was very complex, as this was a big city, rivaling Montore. Individual houses weren't identified, but most shops were there. While looking it over, Lupin spotted Nok's workshop, tucked in between a dye artist and a hatter. This was the former workplace of Orin, Bou's mapa.</p>

<p>"Nok's shop!" Lupin exclaimed, the sudden sound startling the cartographer.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, have you been standing there long?"</p>

<p>"No no," Lupin said, "you're busy, I'll comeback later."</p>

<p>"Busy, yes. I'm always busy. Since I never stop being busy you ought to ask me what you need now, and it'll be up to me to tell you whether or not I can help."</p>

<p>"Oh, well my friend & I are going to Edonor. We need corrections on our map, it's a bit—um, aged. We heard there was a new village between it and Renate."</p>

<p>The cartographer nodded, and then waved a hand, asking for Lupin to come forward. Lupin did just that, approaching slowly, walking over the map and avoiding freshly-painted markings. The Verido unrolled the map and laid it over the floor, going down on hands and knees, mirroring the cartographer's position. "I'm Lupin."</p>

<p>"Mapoleon." the cartographer replied.</p>

<p>Lupin's eyes widened then. "Really? What a coincidence..." It was no coincidence. Earlier that morning, Lupin had passed in front of this very tent and had seen the name. What happened is that the Verido forgot, but the mass of muscle inside this head did not, it thought this combination of letters interesting and put it away for later use.</p>

<p>Mapoleon's eyes were stuck on Lupin's map, hand was already busy correcting mistakes, adding newly-built bridges, danger areas and such. “Didn’t happen to see an Ilk on your way over here have you? It’s late."

<p>"An Ilk is coming here...?" Lupin was sweating now, "um... whi-which one?"</p>

<p>“Ilk of Balandri,” Mapoleon answered, "supposed to arrive soon, we hope.”</p>

<p>Lupin glanced outside through an opening in the wall, heart beating hard, trying to break out from its enclosure. After the corrections, Lupin thanked the cartographer and hurried back over to Hush. Eka wasn’t back yet and Hush was resting, fast asleep in a recess in the ground—a sure way to keep cool. Lupin waited, with eyes on the horizon. Memories of Volare rushed into Lupin's mind, memories of a place this Verido wanted to forget. Just then, Lupin heard people shouting.</p>

<p>“It's here! The Ilk of Balandri is here!”</p>

<p>The Ilk arrived from the south—not its usual path. The whole town was a swirling mess. People amassed empty carts and bags, gathering tools and extra hands, all were getting ready to help unload the Ilk. Lupin noticed a tall ramp, with people running up the steps, getting ready to greet the visitors. This ramp wasn't unfamiliar to Lupin, but these eyes had never seen it from a ground perspective. From down here, the ramp looked frail and unsteady, swaying from side to side as people scaled its numerous steps.</p>

<p>The Ilk arrived at last and came to stand by the platform. Ilk were impressive creatures, skinny, long-legged, giant three-toed feet, long thin faces with a great big set of horns. On their backs, they carried a small Verido town. “The Ilk of Balandri is here!!” The people of the town shouted. Not long after it arrived, caretakers were already preparing bags of teaweet grain to feed it withs. Others were busy brushing the sand of its skin, picking rocks from its toes. Other workers pushed steps over to the side of the Ilk, to make a pathway up to the town. People would be coming on and off of it all week.</p>

<p>"This is so exciting!” Eka said to Hush, having just returned to their camping spot in the city. Hush lifted its head to stare at the Ilk, unimpressed. Next to the hyroo, was Lupin, who bore the same disinterested gaze. Hush continued to sleep, but Lupin could not stop watching the Ilk. Eka went to pat Lupin on the head. "Aren't you excited?" But the Verido said nothing.</p>

<p>The quiet town from this morning had turned into a bustling open-air market. Various vendors and store owners from Balandri were setting up shop in a field, previously occupied by masses tumbling weeds. The place was full of life and colour, people laughing and shouting. Eka took a seat and watched, the market was set up right near to their spot. Already, some Balandrian Veridos were wandering the encampment. Like Lupin, they had tan-skinned, elongated ears like delicate flutes of skin, and they all bore colours in their faces, varying in placement and pattern. Balandrian were tattooed with red, rather than blue like those from Volare.</p> 

<p>Eka was glancing from Lupin and back to the people of Balandri. “Dont you want to say hello Lew blue?”

<p>“To what end?”</p>

<p>Eka took Lupin's side. "Suit yourself. They are impressive though aren't they?"

<p>“Nearly 400 meters tall..."</p>"

<p>The Voice of the Balandri Ilk was walking through town, Lupin quickly took note of it. They’d never met, but those that bear the title of Voice are easy to recognize, as they all bear a set of robes, unique to the role. Lupin had long since discarded those robes, but the blue tattoos remained. For a moment, Lupin wanted to hide, but found that no part of this body wanted to obey. The feet were cemented in sand, the torso heavy, linked to the spot by invisible chains.</p>

<p>Eka gave a loud whistle then. The sound caught the ear of Klev, the Voice of the Balandri Ilk. Klev's eyes turned toward them. Lupin's dumb body could not be persuaded to move, but it was too late now anyway. As the blue tattoos and ears were a dead giveaway. Klev pushed through the market folk and vendors and arrived at their little camp.</p>

<p>“You are far from home.” Klev said.</p>

<p>Lupin nodded. “Yes, though technically that would depend entirely on its whereabouts...” Only those with a birthplace with legs could say this.

<p>“I admire you! I can’t imagine leaving Balandri. It’s very brave to venture out into the unknown like this, you must have seen much of the world."</p>

<p>“I have” Lupin said, while a confused soup of pride and sadness swished around in this gut. This Verido was happy to have traveled the land and to have met its people, but over time, a hard lump appeared on the side of this head. Whenever thoughts of Volare circulated in this brain, the accursed thing latched onto the memories like a thirsty vampire and gained mass. Then, the simple act of standing on one’s legs became difficult, the weight of it unbearable. “Any word of Volare?” Lupin managed to say, a hand massaging the ghostly-protrusion on this skull back down.</p>

<p>“Moving along the Ash plains, last I heard.”</p>

<p>“East?” Lupin said, alarmed. “But that would take them to the Rupture!"</p>

<p>Klev shared Lupin's concerns. “It’s what I’ve heard. Word is that the Ilk of Volare is dying. It’s why I felt I had to come and speak to you when I saw you were of Volare. I don't know if you know this, but their Voice died last year. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news... but it has to be known. A tragic fall. All Verido are scared, what does this mean for our race? The Ilk may walk into the Rupture, and take the city along with it. Balandri and Otora people fear that their Ilk will follow their kin in death.”

<p>Lupin wondered what or who was causing this. "What are you doing Mago… why is this happening? Surely you would have found the words to dissuade it." 

<p>Lupin did not waste time, and went to visit Mapoleon the cartographer once more. "I need whatever update you have for the East road, Ash Plains and all the way to The Rupture." Lupin then spent a good half hour trying to convince Mapoleon to do the work. The cartographer was trying to convince the Verido not to take the Leap. "I swear to you, I'm not going there to die." Lupin said.</p>

<p>"I'm happy to hear it." The concerned cartographer finished adding the desired modifications.</p>

<p>Map in hand, Lupin returned to their encampment then. "Eka!" Lupin began, "change of plans, we're going east to intercept Vol." Eka was draped over Hush, arms laid out over its sides, caressing the large furry beast. "Okay Lew, east we go!" The Verido eyed Eka carefully, "you don't want to know why? Or is it one of those situations where you already know why and that I'm an idiot for asking. Let me guess, you spoke to the Ilk?"</p>

<p>Eka smirked. "You poor tortured soul."</p>

<p>"I'm scared Eka."</p>

<p>Eka had anticipated this sudden shift in mood, and was already halfway to Lupin, coming for a hug. "I know." They stood in each other arms for a long while. "If we walk we'll never make it on time." Lupin said, breaking the silence, eager, and anxious to find a solution. "I think I know how." Eka said.</p>

<p>Eka lead Lupin to the northermost edge of the city, where several sandfings were moored to pilings. Hush accompanied them on this trek, and bounded ahead to a carcass of a vessel, laying on it side. Its sails were in tatters, and its hull, dry and punctured. It bore the name "Tarka" Lupin walked over to it, and climbed into the cabin to assess the damage. "It's not looking too bad! But um—who does it belong to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I know who knows." Eka said, guesturing to another ship moored in the area, a vessel with a red hull bearing the name Ethyl.</p>

<p>"Nono's in town!"</p>

<p>They returned to the site that very same night, hoping to find Nono there. Lupin could see someone was in the vessel, a light was on. This resembled that night long ago, when they'd spotted the sandfin in the dark. "Nono's home." The Verido said, relieved.</p>

<p>"NANA'U NONO!" Eka shouted.</p>

<p>They heard lots of noise inside, and then Nono's head came pushing out of one of the portlights. Nono's eyes were healthy this time, and found them in the dark with ease. "Nana'u aikana dii!" Nono shouted, smiling. "Come in! Come in!"</p> 

<p>They all went inside of Ethyl, with Nono promptly serving everyone overisized mugs of bonan wine. Lupin eyed the tall glass, and was determined to keep Nono from re-filling it once empty, a hard task. Drinking bonan wine was a good way to keep anxiety away though, Lupin thought. Eka threw an arm around Lupin then. "We have time for this okay? Don't worry." Lupin loved hearing Eka say this, because it always turned out to be true.</p>

<p>Nono eyed Hush for a moment, with its head peering inside and the rest seated outside. "Ipaya?" Nono said, offering the hyroo a mug. Hush gave it a lick, but did not enjoy the taste. Nono laughed, and instead served the hyroo a bowl of mashed bams. "Sou mawani ta dodon oro!"</p>

<p>"Good for the soul and the stomach." Eka translated. "Looks delicious! Enjoy bud!" Already, Hush's face was buried in the bowl, and licked it all up in a second.</p>

<p>"What brings you here?" Lupin asked Nono.</p>

<p>"Nono deliver teaweet from Montore for Balandri Ilk."</p>

<p>"Oh? Renate villagers asked for extra feed?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no. Teaweet is gift." Nono corrected.</p>

<p>"From who? Why?" Lupin asked, perplexed. People in Montore didn't exude generosity, certainly not those with coin.</p>

<p>"Nono know this, but told no say."</p>

<p>Lupin laughed, "that's okay, I think I might know who. Not many endowed philanthropists in Montore." Despite having little evidence, Lupin knew who was responsible for this generous donation. This bit of good news warmed this heart, and the Verido raised a mug-full of bonan wide "to people who care!"</p>

<p>"To people who care!" They all said again, together.</p>

<p>"Do you know if Tarka belongs to anyone?" Lupin asked Nono then.</p>

<p>Nono thought about the name for a moment. "Iana. Abandon, many many year abandon."</p>

<p>Lupin's eyes lit up then, with the Ilk in town they would have all the parts they needed to repair it. Plus they had metal workers  they could count on, and a skilled sandfinner to help with the kinks. This was a weight off this Verido's shoulders, Eka could tell. They drank their drinks, and Lupin once again failed to keep Nono from re-filling their cups. The night ended with both eating mashed bams, as a way to soak it all up.</p>

<p>The next day, they marched over to Ren's tent to ask for him. Ren gladly accepted, and helped to patch up the holes in the hull. Nono was hard at work mending an old sail, one that spent many years in Ethyl's bilge, unused. The sail would work fine, but needed some work. While Lupin added fresh paint and coordinated the work. Soon, the sandfin was repaired and all they needed to do was to test it. On the first run, the rudder fell off, on the second, they found a leak in the fuel tank. The third and fourth run revealed even more problems, but after that they found less and less. On run number 12, the sandfin skidded on the desert plains beautifully, nothing was rattling or threatening to break off. They proceeded to stocking it up with food and supplies for the journey ahead, bags of teaweet flour, crates of wet stones, purple kappages, sweet bams, mapples etc.

Before leaving, Klev, Nono and Ren came by and visited the vessel. All were impressed with their work, Klev was jealous of Lupin for having found strangers that he could share time with. By then, Lupin had explained what had happened and that he was going to help Volare. Klev feared his life, but then again, he feared for his kin. He gifted Lupin and the others with Balandri robes, “They will keep you cool when the sun is high, and will shield your skin from sand.”

They shared an evening of drinks and stories — Klev imparted his best Verido jokes, Ren told some Iride legends; all that, paired with Nono’s sandfin stories, made for quality entertainment.

Later into the night, Klev, Nono and Renzo became red with alcohol. Klev had a {{donmol}}, an old instrument thought to have belonged to Balandri. Klev's fingers stroked the 4 double strings, creating a tune that only other Verido — or wonders like Eka — could interpret. Lupin smiled, attentive to the song, about mountains that could not kneel, moons that could not sleep, and of fires that could not touch. Eka was standing, busy expressing the meaning of the song through absurdly exaggerated gestures. Nono and Ren watched, each mind interpreting the patomime in their own way "Oh, oh, OH! I see, I see! A Durdle, yes. It is hungry! Also, it cannot swim." Nono said. "No, no. It's about the journey of a great warrior," Renzo corrected.

After the song ended, Nono began reciting a poem about a loose bit of twine on Klev's pant leg:

    Bit of standing twine,
    Many sands it longs to see,
    Blade cometh, too soon.

At the phrase, Nono inched forward and cut the bit of twine away with a blade, cackling. Everyone roared with laughter. Nono then proceeded to fill all of the empty mugs with Bam Ale — another Finiku favorite. "Drink up drink up!" Nono said, tapping the bottom of Lupin's cup, causing some of its content to spill. "I am I am!" Lupin cried. All in the group were merry, all, but Nono and Eka, they too had consumed the same amount but it had little effect. “To good genes!" Nono said, raising a mug of ale up high. "I stopped by Ministe during one of my deliveries,” Nono said, turning to Eka. “I asked about your woth,” The Finiku went on, filling up Eka’s mug again.

Experiencing thirst in Nono's presence was impossible, Eka thought, the Finiku was hyperaware, knew the level of liquid present in each mug at all times and insisted that the bottom of the recipient remain unseen.

“We haven’t found its name yet,” Eka said.

“In time, in time!” Nono replied, “I brought my notes to my friend, the woth expert, said that yours is a super woth! They grow to be quite big you know! Used to be more in the old days, it's a rare trait nowadays, one that I thought only the 'tall ones' possessed, if you believe in that sort of thing.” Saying this, Nono's eyes glassed over. "I believe it." Within seconds, Nono drifted to another place entirely, recalling a moment thought lost, something that had happened years ago...

"Where we going?" A young Nono asked, a broad leaf sat over the Finiku's head. Nono's eyes were wet, bulging, body wrapped in a bulky green sweater.

"To the Rupture my love," Winny said, pulling the young sproutling along, "it's your grandmapa's leaping day."

Etyl was sitting atop a Vennec, body wrapped in a thick blanket, head drooping forward, asleep.

Etyl was a loud mouth, strong of will and of body, the person coiled into that blanket was different, tired. Nono was very close to Etyl, it made her very sad when she fell ill. Etyl was the first Finiku to circumnavigate the world by sandfin unaided; and now, she lay in bed, pale and weak. Her illness had robbed her of her independence. After years of this, she sought ways to be free of it, and decided to make her final voyage to the rupture.

Nono and her mother accompanied Etyl there by sandfin. The rupture, as she described, was full with people. Some stood by to discourage people from taking the leap; others were there to try and profit from the dying, in any way they could. Without a word, she watched grandma Ethyl leap into the rupture. Nono saw her disappear into the blackness, swallowed up whole. They stayed for the night, but she couldn’t sleep. Images of her grandmother, falling, kept coming to mind. She snuck out, and went to stand on the edge of the rupture again, as if hoping to see her grandmother emerge, having changed her mind. She wasn’t there, but what she did see…

“...was a giant figure, slipping into the depths! It walked right into the hole.” Nono took a breath, “One of the tall ones!”

Klev had overheard what Nono had said, “I’ve heard rhymes about it, things we’d say when we were kids. One of them goes, ‘One can only be tall if the other is small’.”

Ren too was listening, everyone had gathered around the fire, completely enthralled by this new topic. Lupin and Eka listened, but both kept silent.

The night ended with everyone sleeping around a dying flame, all, but Lupin and Eka. They had been traveling together for some time, yet there was still one thing he had never asked.

“You didn’t look surprised when you saw me come to get you, all those years ago,” Lupin never had this conversation with her, in truth, he’d been avoiding it.

“Someone always comes,” she said with a kind smile.

“If not me… then someone else?” Lupin said, he felt unimportant suddenly. Had Uno chosen him? Or had he fallen at the right place, at the right time? He wanted to believe the latter.

Eka could tell it was bothering him, “No. Couldn’t have been anyone else. Couldn’t have happened any other way,” she reassured him, as she rolled over to where he was, lying shoulder to shoulder with him. “Though others have come before you, but you weren’t born then so you have a good excuse,” she said with a smirk.

“You’re getting real tall,” Lupin noted, his shoulder brushing against hers. They would lie like this together often; but now, her shoulders were not level with his anymore.

"You noticed that huh?" Eka knew that it made people uncomfortable to talk about what she was, it’s why she didn’t insist on talking about it. Lupin was different, like all who had come for her up that mountain.

"What happens when you get real big?"

Eka thought for a moment, it was hard to imagine how the bigger self could think. She explained it, as best she could "The taller I get, the more detached I feel." She threw an arm around him, pulling him close with her cheek pressing up against his "You mustn't take it to heart Lupin, promise me you won't."

Lupin bit his lip, its what he thought that had always scared him about her. He would never admit that it made him sad, but he couldn't hate her for it "I won't, I promise Eka."

Another question was begging to be asked, pushing up his throat and backed up against his teeth, “Why aren’t you together? You and him?” he asked, twiddling his thumbs, anxious to hear her answer.

Eka was drawing invisible picture on his back, smirking “We used to be, but it’s better if we don’t sleep at the same time. We sleep a long while you know, too much could happen. We'd hate to miss even a sliver of it.”

Lupin looked at her, as if he had yet another question; but this one, he couldn’t ask. He was afraid that she forget him, it pained him to think he could lose her to Uno. It was foolish, Eka was infinitely kind and ever-mindful of the feelings of others; but the truth was that she had lived many more years than he, he felt like a tiny grain of sand in her presence. Oh how he wished that he too, could live forever.

Eka rolled away again and onto her back, her woth walked along her stomach in search of a good spot to sleep in. When it settled into a fold of her shirt, she began to stroke the ends of the hairs on its back. A low hum sounded, escaping from her throat. She hummed for a while, until she knew for certain that Lupin was asleep.

The next morning, Lupin woke to the sound of arguing. Nono was awake, unaffected by the alcohol, standing at the foot of a Beobug sandfin that had come to dock here in the night. The vessel had kinked NOno's vessel in the process, an 'accident' that Nono believed was deliberate. "Where is your captain?" NOno shouted, knowing all too well that Gree was likely hiding aboard the vessel.

The Verido walked up to NOno to stare at the vessel, then looked up and noticed Gree at one of the portholes. Lupin whistled, "HEY! Come down, that's hardly respectable! Hiding like that!"

"Hiding?!" Gree shouted, "Absurd!" Gree exited the sandfin in a huff, ready to smack whoever had insulted him but then, noticed who it was... "The Voice of Volare! What an honor!"

Klev, who too had just awoken overheard this... ears perked up.

"Stop right there" Lupin said, "did you wreck this vessel on purpose?"

"NO no no no" Gree said, in a no no kind of way.

Nono's skin reddened at this, and jumped on Gree's back, pulling his ears and screaming into them "You FIEND! Blubbering boob!" Gree shouted back, running in circles. "Is this a tactic to make me captain your ship?!"

"NO no Gree would never!"

"NAIBAKA! Gree always lie!" Nono ruffled up Gree's perfectly combed hair, and grabbed onto his nose, a hand pulling at each nostril.

Gree's eyes started to water, "IAAA what are you doing?!"

Lupin was tempted to separate them, but found it all too amusing, besides, Gree deserved it.

"OKAY OKAY" Gree shouted then, "I DID DO IT ON PURPOSE!" Gree admitted.

Nono let go, slipped off and watched the Finiku, eyes thin and angry. "And so the truth comes out."

"I'm as good as you, I've never been! You have a talent NOno, that ive always envied. I took this job to impress you! Thats all it was."

Nono was not impressed, "Well you have failed in that certainly. You have no moral compass."

Gree looked genuinely sad then, ears dropping. "That is... not false." Even when down, Gree did not like to give straight answers. "What if i said i would listen to you."

Nono laughed, "now what kind of ploy is this i wonder?"

"No ploy" Gree reassured her.

"Um, then you can stop captaining that ship, and you can go back home to our Mapa to apologize, to say the truth about me." & Lupin's eyes widened then, "Is gree... your sibling?" Lupin did rememeber Gree saying that they'd been grown on the same plot of land... and that he had poisoned her mother against her. Could it be that?

Nono nodded, "Unfortunately. The truth is Gree and I were intertwined in growth, our stems criss-crossed one another. Gree's system leeched off my nutrients, i could have died. In the end, We were separated, with success, but this one has never stopped trying to smother me."

Gree was fidgetting nervously, "Smother? Could i help it? NO i could not Nono! You're the one who's always rejected me! There's a reason you were given that name, because youd say those two words whenever you caught of me!"

"Even as a sprout i wanted tnothing with you! You have always been vile!"

Lupin remembered what Zucca had said about sprouts in the ground, how they developed links to one another, and the sadness of one could affect its neighbour. Since both had grown together, linked-up, they had developed a bond unlike any other. Gree depended on Nono, more than he cared to admit, and Nono wanted tod istance herself as much as possible. Nono chose to ignore the bond, while Gree was faced with a growing hole inside, one that he filled with ventures to impress NOno back into his good grace. Nono's revulsion of Gree was planted even before sprouted, an inate dislike.

"How about you two sandfin together?" Lupin suggested

"Ive no desire to work for a company fueled by coin and greed!"

"Aboard Etyl."

Gree looked at Nono, "but that would Beobug 1 without a captain..."

"As if that ship needs you to sail! It is fully automated!"

"So its decided then! Youll travel together from now on" Lupin said.

Nono realized what ha dbeen said just now, "No nonoonono." but before Nono could nono any further, Lupin let out a whistle, as loud as anyone had ever heard. Even the Ilk of Balandri turned its head to look.

Gree nodded, "Okay, together." Nono did not want this, at all. "It's a terrible idea, ive spent my entire life distance myself from this vilain"

"Maybe it's time to-revisit those feelings. You are family, and family, like community, is important. It's everything." Saying this, Lupin started to cry a little, Lupin had never cried before, especially not in front of others. Lupin went to sit on the ground, hands buried deep in his hands, his entire body shaking. The Verido was overcome with grief, unconsolable. The itch Lupin had had grown and spread, and caused the body great pain. Lupin, longed for home. This is a pain that had been long ignored. All the riches and wonders of the world were no replacement for community. While Lupin had loved his time out here, he longed for the simple day to day... relishing in the simple pleasures.

Gree stared, uncomprehending. Nono too, was puzzled by this sudden reaction "O-okay," Nono said, "We will travel together. I will try to be patient. I promise" Gree looked at Nono, relieved, went to get his Beobug cap but Nono slapped it out of his hands "No, not this." Both Finiku continued to bicker, but more quietly this time. They talked about how to plan for the trip ahead.

Lupin was on the ground still, unable to calm down. Brokenhearted. This is when Klev stepped in, the Voice of Balandri went to sit next to him. "Why didn't you say you were Voice. Everyone thinks you're dead. Word traveled between cities... everyone heard. You were mourned across 3 cities Lupin. It's a miracle you survived."

Lupin shrugged, unable to speak words.

"You've got to home." Klev said to the Verido then, throwing an arm around his brother.

"I can't... the balance."

"Sometimes, we have to look past sacrifice and politics. Especially in times like this, I think your city needs you."

Lupin raised his head, glanced at the Ilk of Balandri. "They'll think i betrayed them..."

"You fell," Klev said, "How is that a betrayal."

"I didn't try to go back. I never wanted to be Voice, maybe I did fall on purpose..."

"Maybe" Klev said, "Maybe you were meant to. To come here, to meet Eka... to learn about the world on the ground. If what I think is happening with the Ilk is happening, we'll need someone like you to help us adapt to life on the ground. I dont like to think about it, in fact, ive been sick all day."

"I'd be a poor teacher.." Lupin said, but then began to think back on all the past exerpeicens he's had, and a different picture of himself began to form in his head. Lupin was strong, resilient, understanding... caring. These were the qualities of a teacher, of a good teacher. "Okay" Lupin said then, "Okay." Lupin stood up, and began to whistle to the Ilk. The Ilk of Balandri was eating Teaweet and stopped in mid-chew to listen.

Klev listened to the message, and smiled. "They will be happy to hear you're alive."

Lupin nodded, "Yes, I think so..."
