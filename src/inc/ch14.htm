<h2>— Chapter 14 —</h2>
<img src="../media/content/fauna.snakadil.jpg" />
<p>Lupin stared at their vessel, with its patched hull, up-cycled sails, hand-woven lines, and was proud. Tarka was ready. That morning all contributors dipped their hands in plurple bean grease and stamped them on the sandfin's stern. Now everyone would know that restoring Tarka was a collaborative effort. Lupin noted the different sized hands, and could associate each one with its owner. Nono's hand was nearest to the ground, small and covered with cracks, due to years of handling ropes, Renzo's hand was larger, with thin fingers, while Maka's print was the largest, textured, with thick, rounded fingers. Eka's hand was small, bigger than Nono's. "Your palms are very wrinkly Eka." Lupin noted. Eka was getting the last basket of supplies onto the sandfin, "and it's why I'm a better climber." Saying this, Eka smirked and disappeared inside. Lupin's palm bore Verido patterns, a series of lines and dots. Lupin thought of home again then, but wasn't sad, because the memories were no longer laced with guilt.</p>

<p>Eka prepared breakfast that morning, pouring tea into the mugs of their companions. Lupin passed some bonan leaf plates around, each one had slices of toasted muckwheat bread with a generous dollop of spiced bam puree. Klev and Ren hadn't yet recovered from yesterday's drinking, they didn't have the stomach for breakfast. Maka and Nono happily consumed their portions.</p>

<p>After breakfast Nono inspected the deck, outer hull and rigging again, and deemed this vessel voyage-ready. "Ora! It time for Tarka to fly!"</p>

</hr>

<p>Later that afternoon, Eka was with Hush, caressing the beast's large parabolic ears. "I'm sorry you can't come with us on Tarka." The hyroo had grown too large for a sandfin, even Eka could not stand upright in the cabin. Hush could follow by foot for a while, but Eka knew that it would be too tiring. The Wonder caressed the hyroo's soft cheeks and head, hands grabbed the sides of the beast's snout. Hush let out a whine, but did not protest any further. "We'll come back for you soon, I promise."</p>

<p>Nono had more deliveries to make, and was already busy filling Etyl with packages. Gree was on board, dressed in plain clothes, hatless, and was taking the boxes from Nono's hands and organizing them below deck. It warmed Lupin's heart to see them together, but knew that it wouldn't be an easy transition. Nono was tense, and Gree, quiet.</p>

<p>Klev would leave Renate soon too with the Ilk. Ren would remain in Renate, and had agreed to care for Hush in their absence. The younglings of the town were happy with this arrangement, all were gathered around the hyroo, stroking its fur, a mess of tiny hands ran in its mane like teeth on a comb.</p>

<p>"Hush is going to be well cared for." Renzo said, stroking the side of Hush's head. The apprentice had grown fond of Hush, especially after their little adventure in Irideri.</p>

<p>Eka watched Hush, licking away at the faces of the Renate sproutlings. The hyroo was content, focused on this little brushing session. "I can see that." Eka said.</p>

<p>By now, Eka was as tall as Ren. . Eka looked the Iridi in the eye, and put their foreheads together, with one hand sliding behind Ren's head, fingers interlaced with dark curls. They had experienced a lot together. They said nothing. Eka smiled and pulled away before doing the same to Klev, they had not known each other long, but felt close. Everyone they met touched their lives in a big way, and Eka carved a spot in this heart for everyone of them. Nono was next in line, Eka knelt down to match the Finiku's petite height. "I found the woth's name."</p>

<p>Nono's eyes widened in surprise. "Ara! Nono is happy to hear!"</p>

<p>Eka leaned in close to whisper the name. "Sou'sou di!" Nono said, ecstatic.</p>

<p>Nono pulled Eka in close, the Finiku's short arms barely able to encircle the wonder. The Finiku reached into a pocket and pulled out a barass compass. "Gran-mapa Etyl use this for to sail Soronan Desert. It not know failure. It gift."</p>

<p>Lupin also said goodbye, but spent the most time with Klev, chatting away in <a href='lexicon.html#ilken'>ilken</a>. Both Verido were using the short form, whistling away while the villagers stared, perplexed by the absence of a worded conversation.</p>

<p>Then finally, came time to get under way. The two stepped aboard the sandfin and raised the sails, having picked a windy day to cast off, the sails filled with air and the sandfin plowed forward. All in the village waved as they pushed through the sand, Nono held a scarf up, the wind catching it and sending ripples throughout. The others in the group did the same. As Eka and Lupin left Renate, they could see the scarves undulating in the wind in the distance, like colourful arms of knitted fabric. Lupin could hear the Ilk of Balandri singing a parting tune, the sound resounding throughout the desert. The Verido knew that this song would catch Vol's ear, and for a moment, wondered if perhaps it would convince it to slow its pace, or change its course. Lupin knew this was silly though, as it is impossible to dissuade anyone from taking a Leap. When the body and mind are ready, little can be done. Lupin's mind went to Levi then, and to a day they'd spent together in Volare...</p>

<p>There was nothing special, or important about that day, and that's why Lupin liked it. Levi was feeding Henbi, then put a nose to the bubbly and sour smellydough starter, smiling, before proceeding to picking through a sac of freshly-picked woodgeon berries. Lupin's heart ached then, troubled by thoughts of Henbi. No one was there to feed it. The smellydough starter was a family heirloom, all members of Lupin's family had handled it, and contributed to its health and growth, feeding it everyday, and baking with it for years and years. Lupin liked watching it expand and settle during the day, like it was breathing. Henbi was likely dead now. Lupin swallowed hard, sitting with this incredible loss for a moment before returning to the main memory. Levi was crouched down over a large bowl full of dry woodgeon berries, hands running through them to shake the skins off. In this memory, Lupin was lying in the hammock on the upper floor, with the overhead shutter open to invite in the sun. Lupin's skin was warm, and this nose could detect the subtle fragrance of the woodgeon berries as Levi moved them around, these ears also helped to form the memory, remembering the sound of Levi's fingers catching the bottom of the bowl. This memory made Lupin happy and sad, these two emotions manifesting together at the same intensity. This Verido sat with this wonderful memory too for a while, and then let it dissipate. That day, Lupin made a plan to try and plant a garden in the desert, like Zucca.</p>

<p>"I wonder if woodgeon shrubs can grow down here..."</p>

</hr>

<p>Tarka was sailing itself, bow pointed toward the Rupture. The wind was with them that day, and they were making good progress. As Renate faded away, they settled into their respective tasks, taking bearings, checking the horizon for obstacles or other vessels. Lupin took notes on a map.</p>

<p>About midday, the wind died. Lupin kept an eye on the horizon for wind, but not a single grain of sand was shifting. With all of this time to think, the Verido remembered the <b>Tale of three</b>, Uno's gift. Every page was full of annotations and drawings, Uno had tracked the paths of the 3 Ilks for years and years. The world route was pictured in here, along with all of their usual stops. Most interesting of all, were the added notes on the three founders Otora, Balandri and Volare. Lupin couldn't believe it, Uno had been there with them! There was written several of their conversations and meetings throughout their lives, it seemed as though Uno had first showed Volare the nesting grounds of the ilk. The book had handwritten letters scattered throughout, one of them was written by Volare! It was written in ilken, a series of notes, like a set of instructions to play a song. Those with a background in music could play some of it, but a lot of the characters would be foreign to them. Some of the sounds could not be produced easily in song, even the whistled language was not perfect in this way. The meaning of it was meant for very few eyes, the letter was addressed to Uno...</p>

</hr>

<p><i>"Today the Verido have found salvation. To think that the solution lies with the giant desert walkers, our friends. Our collaboration will ensure both of our futures on this rock. This is something I do not like to think about, of us, or them, falling into nothing. I thought maybe that the Ilk were beyond death, it saddens me that it isn't so. Their lives, like yours, are finite, and near-spent. I will keep my promise to you dear though friend, we will care for them until the very end. Already, I've secured dealings with cities, they will provide teaweet on passage, and we, will carry items for them, and sell items that we produce using anything at our disposal, anything growing on the Ilk. The world really is changing though isn't it? Food is scarce, at least, it is, for giants like the Ilk... there is little room for giants in this new world, is what you said to me, but I do not believe it. You are still here, aren't you dear friend? If so, there is hope, I have to believe it. You did say you were tired, and that the problems plaguing our rock are troublesome, but believe me when I say you've got a place here, and always will. I trust this message reaches you, have a good rest, you deserve it... more than most."</i></p>

<p>When Lupin finished reading it, this heart was racing. "Already then, Volare knew the Ilk were dying, Uno did too." The Verido continued to turn pages, finally arriving at the main story...</p>
</hr>
<h3>A tale of three</h3> 
<p>During a year of storms, 3 Verido siblings, Orota, Balandri and Volare took it upon themselves to save their race from the hardships of the desert. The eldest, Orota, proposed that they construct a moving machine. A contraption that could keep the town moving, so they could stay ahead of the weather. All places on this dust planet were dangerous at one point or another. The Verido were a nomadic tribe, they believed it was important to keep moving. After designing this machine on paper, they realized that it would not be possible to build.</p>
<p>Such a machine would require insane amounts of propulsion crystals, it was too extractive, this detail worried Balandri. They would need to dig the earth to mine the crystals, further damaging the desert. The Veridos had great respect for nature. Balandr, in turn, proposed that it be powered by wind, like sandfins. But no one in the land could help design a sandfin large enough to carry a small city. They considered a flotilla of smaller vessels too, but given their sizable population it seemed difficult.</p>
<p>Volare, who had once walked the entirety of the Soronan Desert by foot, proposed that they do just that. The others did not share Volare's love of trekking through hot deserted lands. The young and elderly would not survive.</p>
<p>Volare thought on this for a long time, and was then visited by a tall stranger. "I have a solution for you." The giant said. The next day, Volare announced to Otora and Balandri that salvation was at hand. Together, they trekked across the desert to a mountain, following the giant's instructions. They rested in the day, and travelled at night. Eventually, they reached the mountains, and went through a pass dug in its middle. On the other side, they found 3 Ilk, busy grazing on bibiskiss and hempawoods. The 3 appeared thin.</p>
<p>The giant told Volare that they lived here together. 3 Ilks, 3 Verido nothing could be more perfect.</p>
<p>The Ilk were desert walkers, creatures that measured at least 1400 mirits. They had strong backs and legs, their feet were wide and gave them stability for walking in sand. In times of storms, they could anchor deep into the soil to wait it out. They had long slender necks, and long snouts with a set of horns.</p>
<p>They spent years learning about these giant beasts, be-friending them. They learned how to approach them and how to communicate. One day, the Ilk lowered their heads and invited the Verido on their backs. This was the beginning of a friendship, one that would last for a long, long time. Each befriended an Ilk, that would come to bare cities with their names before long. The cities were erected on their backs, houses made in the hollows of the hard skin on their spines. They learned to speak with the giants creatures. Before every passage, each sibling would climb up the long neck to the ear.</p>
<p>Travelling on the backs of the Ilk ensured both their survival. The Verido were safe from the weather, and kept the Ilk healthy. Many hands worked at this, keeping parasites off, inspecting every inch of skin, from head to toe for bruises, and tending to them. In fact, one year two Ilk became sick with a rare fungi, but the problem was diagnosed early, and cured. Verido did not use outside materials to build their city, they could build anything using isilk, ilk hairs, and carapace shavings. The Ilk had a tough carapace covering its back, also found on its elbows and knees. It would re-grow after harvested. Every year it was measured, and the Verido would only ever harvest if it had grown back enough. Food was harder to come by, but they soon found ways to grow it.</p>
<p>This happened hundreds of years ago, Orota, Balandri and Volare did die, but the Ilk continued to march. The Veridos became a race of travelling merchants, craftspeople and inventors. They would carry provisions from village to village, where they also sold their wares. This was a way to keep the Ilk fed, as the Verido could not manage it alone. The desert wilds had grown thin, and could no longer sustain 3 Ilks.</p>
