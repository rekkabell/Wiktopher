<p>Lupin's log, day 3</p>

<p>"Dorakesse's passage is a day away, our progress has been good, but slow... the wind comes and leaves as it wants and all we can do is wait. The wind died early this morning, but came back, and we're moving again! Tarka is performing well, the crew is impressed. Our only other sandfin experience was on Etyl, and we think that Tarka measures up well.</p>

<p>Every morning I sweep the sand from the deck before Eka awakens, but it is like trying to dig a hole during a sandstorm... there is always more sand coming, but I do it anyway? It's become a routine of sorts. While I sweep, I look at the deck, make sure everything is fine with our sails too. When Eka gets up, we eat breakfast together. We still have loaves of muckwheat to eat, although I nearly choked on a piece of purple bean sausage. I dipped it in mapple jam and it was like eating flames. Eka laughed, but never did explain...</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I read. I'm also done reading through Volare's letters enclosed in the Tale of Three. Most letters are short, more messages between Volare and Uno, but </p>
