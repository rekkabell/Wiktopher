<p>Day 3</p>

<p>Morning</p>

<p>"Dorake's passage is a day away. Our progress is good, but slow. The wind comes and leaves as it wants, and when it's gone all we can do is wait.</p>

<p>We had such a calm this morning. In complete calms, with still sands and a clear, clear sky, it is difficult to believe that the wind will ever return. A calm reveals a new world. The plants that grow out here, like the cactub and the waterlilly, are perennials. They are hardy plants that can survive almost anything, unless it falls prey to a hunter. They come out of the ground to take in moisture and light, and small avians run out of holes in the ground to hunt them. The life of a desert perennial is a dangerous one. It hides during storms, and when it can surface then it must face groups of hungry, agile creatures.</p>

<p>I became familiar with the layout of the desert while traveling on the Ilk, but I did not see the fauna and flora that live in the sand, imperceptible from a distance. Eka has been teaching me about them all. The more I learn, the better I understand the desert. I rather like learning about these things. It is comforting to know that you are never alone in the desert. There are creature who will only ever show themselves under very specific conditions. Marvelous creatures.</p>

<p>There are reptavians flying around us now, the sounds of their leathery wings evident in this quiet. I've never been good at identifying reptavians—maybe they're crested-hirudines? These ones are quick flyers, their movements jerky, and precise. In Volare we have hololomimos, small, bulgy-eyed reptavians that like to nest in houses. We didn't used to have them, we think they climbed aboard during one of our stops in Montore. They like it on the Ilk because there are plenty of shroos, but of course this is a problem for my people, because our food supply is limited. Every city has its problems, but ours are especially complex. No one wants to harm the hololomimos, so now we have trappers that spend their time searching for nests to move them back on land. When I was last there, the relocation efforts were going well, but they always found more.</p>

<p>I saw a group of avians running back to their holes, and when they did, the wind returned! They sensed it and sought safety, knowing that when the wind returns, that bigger avians and winged reptavians will be able to fly farther, and faster.</p>

<p>I went ahead to raise our sails again. Tarka's hull creaked as it began to progress forward. I pulled in the sheets, and soon the air filled our wings and we started to glide. The calm was over, now it was time to move again.</p>

<p>Tarka is performing well, I'm very impressed with our little orphaned vessel. Our only other sandfinning experience was on Etyl, and I think that Tarka measures up well.</p>

<p>Afternoon</p>

<p>Every afternoon I sweep the sand, but it is like trying to clean sand out of the desert. There is always more sand coming, but I clear it anyway. It's become a routine of sorts. While I sweep, I look at the deck, I make sure everything is fine with our sails too. When Eka gets up, we eat breakfast together. We still have loaves of muckwheat to eat, although I choked on a piece of purple bean sausage this morning. I dipped it in mapple jam and it was like eating flames. Eka laughed, but never did explain.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I continued to read. I've finished reading through Volare's letters in the Tale of Three. Most are short messages between Volare and Uno, but there are also poems. I rather like them, and plan to memorize them to pass the time.</p>

<p>Eka is sitting at the bow, staring ahead at far-away mountains. It is a nice, nice day, and I hope it stays that way.</p>

<p>Having so much time to think is nice, but it also makes me realize how forgetful I am. I remembered that I forgot to ask Renzo about Aristollo. I am so distracted most days that I don't have the mind space to remember these things. Out here, my eyes lock onto the horizon, and thoughts that lay deep inside my brain float to the surface. Some of these thoughts come, and others go. All day they transit in and out of my head. Sometimes, I latch onto a passing thought, and hold onto it to dissect for hours and hours.</p>

<p>I wonder what Eka is thinking about now, I ask a lot and fear I've asked too many times already. Eka doesn't mind I'm sure. I mind. It makes me feel annoying, but I am always so, so curious. Yesterday, Eka was thinking about the mountain top, and the bed of green. I remember that place well, it would make you sleep and collect you to keep forever. Tarka is comfortable, but no place can rival the mountain top, not even my hanging hammock in Volare.</p>

<p>I prepared roasted plumpkin for midday. I scooped out the seeds and will leave them to dry on deck, weather permitting. The seeds are very good to eat as a snack when completely dry. As taught by Eka, we eat one, and toss one. A determined creature could re-trace our steps by following our trail of seeds. I hope that they grow into plumpkins, and that they form a long line of greens across the desert.</p>


<p>The mountain ahead is getting closer and closer. A thick, yellow and brown cloud layer is obscuring its top. Nono did say that a cloud of that color forming there was indicative of rain. Rain. I've never experienced rain before! I am excited, but also worried, because I remember something else Nono said... that if the sky showed that same hue, that it could mean severe localized weather. The cloud doesn't have that shade now, but I'll keep an eye on it."</p>

<p>Evening</p>

<p>It's Eka's turn to prepare food. We had a dinner of bonan chips with a looma root stew! Because Bala was in Renate, we were able to get some of my favorite Verido produce! We now have a basket-full of looma and licky roots. Wiktifir ate some of the left over chip crumbs, glad that we are messy eaters. The deck was licked clean of all food particles, same for our hands.</p>

<p>Wik likes to walk up and down the side of the mast, the tiny hairs on its legs have amazing grip! The wind is a bit stronger now, and still, Wik's still anchored to the mast!</p>

<p>The cloud on the mountain ahead is getting puffier, but again, no sign of yellow brown sky. Eka and I prepared the storm anchor. Neither of us have ever used it before. On our passage to Tiputa on Etyl, we did not experience severe weather. Nono explained how to set it up during one of Tarka's test runs. It was easy. All we had to do was to pull the anchor out of its locker, to attach a long rope rode to it. Then, we had to douse the sails, and throw the anchor off the bow, tying the bitter end to a strong point on deck. Doing it during calm weather wasn't hard, but Nono said it might be challenging with more wind. I practice my knots many times to make sure I could do them well, even in stressful conditions. Mago would be proud.</p>

<p>Eka is a fast learner, and always gets everything right on the first try. I sometimes wish I was the same. I know that wishing for this is useless, because it's not how I am, and my way of being is also fine. I learn slow, but I never forget!</p>

<p>Night</p>

<p>The night's shifts were easy, the wind died again. So I walked around deck all night, reciting Volare's poems aloud. I did not wake Eka with my recitations.</p>

<p>The last poem I learned, goes like this:</p>

<ul>

	The Skyrocks alight,

	Golden sands mask their color,

	The night draws a path.

</ul>

<p>For poetry, I know that there are rules, but I don't know them. Despite not knowing, I will write some of my own someday. I rather like it. We have a few sheets of conk shroo paper that I can use, a gift from the Iridi. But I am already using them to write this logbook.</p>

<p>My writing is not very good. I don't have a lot of writing experience. Levi did teach me, we'd write on large chunks of carapace with loobery juice. I never got to look at my writing for very long, because right after our writing sessions the chunks were passed on to someone else for processing. And so I never did have time to study to better my eye and hand.</p>

<p>Volare's writing has an illustrative quality to it, while mine is crooked and clumsy. Nothing is even. Volare's "A's" look all the same throughout the text. I can see that this is my problem, my letters aren't ever the same. I know what beautiful letters look like, but even if I see them in my mind I can't reproduce them. My letters are wonky, clumsy. Sometimes they shrink to a whisper, or grow big, loud and turbulent. Eka said that with practice I will be able to match the image in my head. I hope so.</p>

<p>The sand floor is barren tonight. Not a single creature in sight. Strange.</p>

<hr />

<p>Day 4</p>

<p>Morning.</p>

<p>I woke up to a roaring sound. The wind had risen, and the entire cabin was shaking. The yukwood hull creaked, it was as if the walls were aching to escape. I saw that there was sand inside of the cabin, covering the stairs and floor near the entrance. The hatch was shut, but sand had found its way inside, slipping through the cracks and filling every corner. I got up in a hurry, looked outside and found a wall of sand. No horizon. I could not see past Tarka's middle. I went back inside to slip on a pair of goggles and a scarf, the speed of that wind pushed the sand at violent speeds, and just like sand had gotten inside of the cabin with ease, it too would a way inside my nostrils in a hurry. Too much could kill me. I followed Eka's tether to the bow, and found my companion there, safe.</p>

<p>All of the sails were down, and looking ahead I saw a line extending out into the sand. The line was stretched out, it was vibrating and led back to our anchor, disappearing behind the yellow veil. We were riding on our storm anchor. Eka too had goggles and a scarf on. We both stared ahead, watching to make sure that the anchor had set. Eka's red hair had a muted color, dim with dust.</p>

<p>The quiet world of yesterday was gone. In such weather all desert-dwelling creatures would hide in their respective shelters. We ought to do the same. Nono had told us that if there aren't any small avians around, then that it is a sure sign that the weather is deteriorating. I should have seen the signs, a barren land is a portent of disaster.</p>

<p>When we were certain that Tarka wasn't going to blow away, we retreated back inside and prepared some food. Eka explained that the wind had picked up fast, and threatened to turn us over. A storm had come under the cover of night. The event I had been dreading had arrived.</p>

<p>Afternoon</p>

<p>Eka and I took turns shoveling sand from the deck. The wind is still screaming into our faces, and became more ferocious as the day warmed. Cautious, we decided to throw another anchor off the bow. If our main anchor failed, then we'd have the second one to depend on.</p>

<p>I have no appetite. My stomach is full with worry, and fear. What I don't eat, Eka takes. As usual, the Wonder doesn't share my fears. I am glad for this, because two worriers would not be very good in this particular situation.</p>

<p>Evening</p>

<p>The accumulating sand is beginning to bury us. I don't know how we'll be able to get the anchors out. We go out often to push the sand off from around the bow, but the wind carries it back before we can make a dent. I wonder if it would not have been better to run with the weather, but I remember what Nono said... running in heavy winds might result in Tarka pitch-polling. Pitch-polling means that the sandfin would roll head first. Few sandfins could recover from such an ordeal, the rig would likely break. I bet that's how this area acquired its reputation of being a graveyard for sandfins.</p>

<p>I still can't eat anything. My whole body is on alert, putting aside regular processes to attend to this stressful event. Hunger doesn't happen under stress, nor thirst.</p>

<p>Night</p>

<p>Both of us stayed awake, the racket outside made it difficult to sleep. We spent a lot of time stuffing bits of fabric into openings, to try and keep the sand out. With time, the sand always finds its way in. It sends fingers of grains through cracks, like soldiers to war. Given enough time its hordes would overwhelm and entomb us.</p>

<p>The mainsail got loose. We could hear it shaking the entire rig. The sail was whipping violently above our heads. The two of us went out to try and lash it back down again. Opening the hatch to exit, even for a second, sent a geyser of grain below. We closed it tight, tied our tethers and felt our way forward, towards the mast. The wind was much stronger now, and the sand scratched any bit of exposed skin. The rocks in the area were all smooth, and now we know why. If we stayed out here too long, we too would start to shrink in size, ground down by the weather.<p>

<p>I had to re-tie the scarf around my mouth and nose many times. The wind has skilled and patient hands, able to untie any knot. The time that it did loosen all the way, I could feel sand funneling inside my nostrils and into my throat. I plugged my nose shut with one hand while Eka rushed over to close the knot again. My throat was burning.</p>

<p>We tied the boom down again and wrestled the sail in. This was a task that required 4 hands. We folded the sail down in sections, with Eka adding rope as we went along. I trust Eka's knots more than my own. It doesn't appear as though the sail was damaged too much, although one batten broke. Fixing a batten is not too difficult, Nono made us carry spares.</p>

<p>We were lucky that the wind did not shred the sail. Nono would hate me using that word. Lucky. Saying that there was no such thing as luck, just good and cautious sandfinners.</p>

<p>I don't know if I will be able to sleep today..</p>

<hr />

<p>Day 5</p>

<p>Morning</p>

<p>The storm abated, and when it did it, rain fell from the sky. A gentle, cool rain. We sat for hours outside in it, smiling, letting it wash the sand from our clothes and skin. It helped wash some of the sand from the deck too. Rain is rare in the Soronan Desert, but the geography here is perfect for it. Now that the wind is down, we can see plants coming out of the soil, their leaves fanning out to try and catch moisture. Nono told us that this place had many hidden waterstone caverns as a result, but no one ever stayed here long enough to uncover them, the area was too dangerous.</p>

<p>After the rain subsided, we began the long task of freeing Tarka from the enormous sand bank that had engulfed it. The whole front of the bow disappeared under a thick, and heavy yellow canopy. Now I understand why Nono insisted on us carrying a pair of heavy shovels. I found my appetite again and ate half of a muckwheat loaf.</p>

<p>Afternoon</p>

<p>We are still busy clearing the sand away. The bow is almost free, but then we'll have to try and retrieve the two anchors. Tarka has with a drum that we can wrap the anchor line around. It has a hole at the top, where we can insert a handle to hoist them back up. I tried to use it but found the pressure to be too great... we need to keep digging.</p>

<p>We keep finding sand inside of the cabin, under floorboards, in cups and within the pages of Volare's book too.</p>

<p>Evening</p>

<p>We've done it. We've cleared most of the obstructions away, and were able to remove both anchors. Our timing couldn't have been better, because the wind is rising. We are both exhausted though, but sleep will have to come later for me. I volunteered to keep watch on deck first. Eka is below, sleeping hard. I can taste sleep in my mouth. Whenever I feel sleep coming I eat a slice of chililly, the sting is enough to keep me awake for a while.</p>

<p>The sails are up and full, we are heading through Dorake's pass under clear skies. The suns are still with us, this too helps keep me awake and alert. The absence of light would rob me of wakefulness in an instant.</p>

<p>While in the pass, I saw masts buried in the sand, their bodies broken, splintered. I placed my hand over my chest as Tarka ghosted by them. Nature's indifference may appear cruel, but Nono told us that only inexperience could bury a sandfinner. Hearing that, I remember being nervous, because we didn't have Nono's expertise. Our teacher assured us that if we kept our eyes on the horizon, that if we smelled the air, and that if we listened well, we would know bad weather is coming. "If sky yellow to brown, sandfinner take sail down". Mnemonics worked well for me too. Nono had said that when you go through Dorake's pass, you make a bet with yourself, that you've understood the signs in the sky, in the clouds and in the air. If you missed any, then things might not end well for you.</p>

<p>Eka told me once that predicting the weather is difficult, there are too many factors. The effect of wind on an area depends on topography, temperature. They interact with one another, and  sometimes another element is thrown into the mix, and their interactions produce unforeseen conditions. To the sandfinner, to the one who doesn't understand this complex network of interactions and number of possible outcomes, this makes nature appear fickle, and mean, which in turn gives way to superstition.</p>

<p>My people are subject to superstition. I am too. I feel good when a series of random actions produces a favorable result. And when I do these things again, and get the same results, then that re-enforces my beliefs. "Wiggle your ears while looking at the sun while holding bread, it makes the wind return. Really! It works! Try it!" But when my rituals don't work, then it is a sign that something out there doesn't agree with me. "Well you've done it now Lupin! You've insulted the weather. The desert hates you, and the wind will never caress your cheeks again." Then the only thing to do is to find a new ritual.</p>

<p>It is silly. I know it is, and it is laughable that I continue despite knowing. Sometimes we need rituals. We need to believe that there is someone responsible for the weather, or lack of it, and that we have the power to change things. Although my time in the desert has taught me that we can't reason with the wind, nor can we will it to change direction. My rituals have become a past time, a game, but nothing more. Shouting at the desert while becalmed did little to appease my anger. These hands cannot wield nature. It is healthier to accept that sometimes local conditions produce a destructive event, and that no celestial being had anything to do with it. It is nature being nature, it buries bodies and vessels without prejudice.</p>

<p>I thought about the graves out here in the desert, the ones not marked by masts. It is possible that we walked over many bodies since our voyage began. If it hadn't been for Uno, I too would be there, buried, forgotten, and unknown to the living. To those laying in unmarked graves, I say to to you that I <b>know</b> you are there. I <b>know</b> you have a story. I will never walk, or sandfin over sand again without thinking of you, and of your possible pasts and futures.</p>

<p>Goodnight fellow travelers. You are now sand. You make up the road that carries our vessel onward. One day I will be sand too, and then we'll have ample time to tell each other our stories.</p>

<p>Night</p>

<p>We've made it through the pass in good weather. After Eka and I traded places, I slept long, and hard. It was the best sleep I've ever had. My mind was still, empty of dreams. Now Encela and Protus are out, they light our way east towards the Rupture. If the wind keeps, and our navigation is correct, then it looks like we will be there the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>I am nervous. I don't know what I'll do when we find Vol, and I'm not sure what I'll do if we don't. I will put this out of my mind until I see Vol, and by then I'll likely be too busy to worry.</p>

<p>Growing up, I remember Levi putting my ear to the ground, to listen to Vol's heartbeat. I could hear it, resonating through its thick carapace. My mapa said it was the most important sound in the world, and that I had to listen to it always. Now I think I understand why my mapa said this.</p>

<p>Tonight I will spend it atop the mast, eyes on the horizon. Being up there calms me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Day 6</p>

<p>Morning</p>

<p>The wind is still with us, but we're the only ones out here.</p>

<p>We are in the East Ash Plains now, it is easy to tell because the ground is no longer yellow. The desert is black, inverted, robbed of color. I've never seen anything like it. Vol's path around the world never included this region, with reason... this is where thing go to die. No one comes here for any other reason, not even as transit.</p>

<p>I imagined that it would be a scary place, its air thick with dread, but it is actually pleasant. There is life here. The area is full of shadow fish. Small, wispy, elongated creatures that swim in the black sand. We've had many dive aboard, startled by our passing. When they land on deck they twist and shimmy their bodies until they've found the edge of the vessel, to freedom. In doing so, they leave little sooty trails everywhere. We passed through an area teeming with them earlier, they exploded out of the ground and covered the deck in black dust. We laughed, no amount of cleaning could rid the deck of this soot. Tarka was now a true creature of the East Plains.</p>

<p>We also saw larger shadow fish, rising out of the sand in the distance. Some measured up to 30 mitres, 3 times Tarka's length. They would launch themselves up, balancing on their flukes for a moment before diving back into the sand. They stayed far away, uninterested in us and our travels.</p>

<p>Evening</p>

<p>Hello precious logbook, this is Eka. I thought I would write because Lupin hasn't found the time to do it, too busy trimming sails and steering Tarka. We've found tracks in the sand, fresh tracks that have not yet been covered with sand. Vol is close, but the wind is weak, so our speed isn't great... this is why Lew Blue is working hard to catch every puff of wind! We were approaching rapidly at first, but this decreasing wind sure has bad timing. It's at times like this that I wish I could take enough air into my lungs to blow into our sails, I bet this is something an Ilk could do.</p>

<p>The logbook will end here for now, my Lew needs me up on deck. We are going to have to work hard to catch up. Good morning, afternoon and goodnight dearest logbook, thank you for allowing your pages to be filled for this purpose, and to document Lupin's thoughts.</p>
