<p>Day 3</p>

<p>Morning</p>

<p>"Dorake's passage is a day away, our progress has been good, but slow... the wind comes and leaves as it wants, and all we can do is wait. The wind left early this morning, but returned, and now we're moving again! Tarka is performing well, I'm very impressed with it. Our only other sandfin experience was on Etyl, and I think that Tarka measures up well.</p>

<p>Every morning I sweep the sand from the deck before Eka wakes up, but it is like trying to dig a hole during a sandstorm. There is always more sand coming... but I do it anyway? It's become a routine of sorts. While I sweep, I look at the deck, make sure everything is fine with our sails too. When Eka gets up, we eat breakfast together. We still have loaves of muckwheat to eat, although I nearly choked on a piece of purple bean sausage this morning. I dipped it in mapple jam and it was like eating flames. Eka laughed, but never did explain.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I continued to read. I've finished reading through Volare's letters in the Tale of Three. Most are short messages between Volare and Uno, but there are also poems. I like them, and plan to memorize them to pass the time.</p>

<p>Eka is sitting at the bow, staring ahead at far-away mountains. It is a nice, nice day, and hope it stays that way."</p>


<p>Afternoon</p>

<p>"Having so much time to think is nice. I just remembered that I forgot to ask Renzo about Aristollo. I am so distracted most days that I just don't have the mindspace to remember these things. Out here, my eyes lock onto the horizon, and thoughts transit in and out of my head. Sometimes, I latch onto a passing thought, and keep it in my head to dissect for hours and hours.</p>

<p>I wonder what Eka is thinking about now, I've asked too much already. Yesterday, Eka was thinking about the mountain top, and the bed of green. I was there, but just having the place described to me makes me want to sleep.</p>

<p>I prepared a meal of roasted plumpkin for midday, I scooped out the seeds and will leave them to dry on deck, weather permitting. The seeds are very good to eat as a snack when completely dry.</p>

<p>The mountain ahead is getting closer, and closer. A thick and grey cloud layer is obscuring its top. Nono did say that a cloud forming there was indicative of rain. Rain. I've never experienced rain before. I am excited, but also a bit worried... because I remember something else Nono said... that if the clouds stretched out to form an anvil, that it could mean severe, localized weather. The cloud doesn't have that shape now, but I'll keep an eye on it."</p>

<p>Evening</p>

<p>It's Eka's turn to prepare food, and served some bonan chips with a looma root stew! Because Bala was in Renate, we were able to get some of my favorite Verido produce! We now have a basket-full of looma and licky roots. Wiktifir ate some of the left over chip crumbs, glad that we are messy eaters. The deck was licked clean of all food particles.</p>

<p>Wik likes to walk up and down the side of the mast, the tiny hairs on its legs have amazing grip! The wind is a bit stronger now, and still, Wik is anchored to the mast, moving with ease.</p>

<p>The cloud on the mountain ahead is getting puffier, but again, no sign of an anvil top cloud. Eka and I prepared the storm anchor just in case. Neither of us have ever used it before. On our passage to Tiputa on Etyl, we did not experience severe weather. Nono explained how to set it up during one of Tarka's test runs. It was easy, all we had to do was to pull the anchor out of its locker, to attach a long rope rode to it. Then, we had to douse the sails, and throw the anchor off the bow, tying the bitter end to a strong point on deck. Doing it during calm weather wasn't hard, but Nono said it might be challenging with more wind.</p>

<p>Eka is a fast learner, and always gets everything right on the first try. I sometimes wish I was the same. I know that wishing for this is useless, because it's just not how I am, and my way of being is also fine.</p>

<hr />

<p>Day 4</p>

<p>Morning.</p>

<p>Last night's shifts were easy, the wind died again. So I walked around deck all night, reciting Volare's poems aloud. I did not wake Eka with my recitations.</p>

<p>The last poem I learned, goes like this:</p>

<ul>
	The Skyrocks alight,
	Sands illuminated,
	Clear into the night.
</ul>
