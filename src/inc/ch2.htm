<p>
  Lupin could hear someone screaming, was it the wind? Or was it the sound of life leaving this body? Lupin would have prefered not to know that skin and bones could scream. The sound was unbearable. The young Volarian did fear death, but
  didn't think that consciousness would part with the flesh in flight, contrary to what the elders in Volare believed.
</p>
<p>
  Leaping from the Ilk's snout was common practice with the old and the sick of the village. All habitants of the <a href="lexicon.html#soronandesert">Soronan Desert</a> celebrated <a href="lexicon.html#leapingday">Leaping Days</a>. Lupin always thought that it was a joyful
  and painless experience, but this was a beautiful lie.
</p>
<p>
  "Returning to the earth is good! There's no pain there. It's a return to normality — ah! Yes, normality. I remember being grown. I couldn't see or smell... but the vibrations, I could hear things. Waves through my flesh. Singing? Someone
  was sitting to me, I remember that! I wonder what else is in here? Can I remember before being grown? Can I remember life as a seed? Or life before that? I can't remember. There's only darkness. Darkness is scary. The absence of senses is
  bad, how can I know I exist without that? But rocks exist, and they can't smell, see or feel. Well at least I think they can't, I wish I'd asked the elders more questions. Maybe that's what it was like to be a seed, and before I was even
  made into that, and before a rock was a rock. I felt nothing then, and after I die I will feel nothing. It'll be the same! That makes it okay to die doesn't it? Yea, it's okay. This is okay. I'm okay—"
</p>
<p>A great dark mass came and hit Lupin then, followed by a wave of pain, and then... nothing.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
  <li><i>"The seeds we sow, we sow. </i></li>
  <li><i>The leaves, the light, they know, they know. </i></li>
  <li><i>The sprouts, they grow, they grow.</i></li>
  <li><i>Heart and mind, below, below. </i></li>
  <li><i>This song they follow, they follow, </i></li>
  <li><i>Out of the earth. Oh, beautiful ones.</i></li>
  <li><i>Hello, hello."</i></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
  <li><i>"Hello, hello."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>With eyes closed, Lupin could feel sand creeping over the legs and torso. The desert was not wasting time burying this body. Nothing would be left of it soon.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>"Below, below."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Bits of broken crossbars lay scattered in the sand. Small breaths escaped from Lupin's mouth, but the lungs longed for a rest.</p>
<p><i>"It’s time to let go, let go."</i> They said. The bones and muscles agreed.</p>
<p><i>"It’s time."</i> The skin and the rest of the organs chimed in, all, but the brain who refused to give in.</p>
<p>
  <i>"Well now, that doesn't rhyme at all does it?"</i> The brain said, <i>it doesn't matter, it's all nonsense anyway. No one is letting go! Not ever!</i>. The brain said these things, ignoring the damage the body had suffered during the
  fall.
</p>
<p><i>"But we're broken!"</i> The left arm and its corresponding muscles cried out in pain. But then, came a rush of adrenaline and the body and mind stopped quarrelling and began to work in unison.</p>
<p>
  Lupin moved to a sitting position, pushing off the ground with a groan. The desert was empty, the Ilk was gone. Lupin watched as sand continued to roll over her legs, the tip of her toes buoying over the surface. Lupin's back found the
  sand floor again. "They're all gone, everyone is gone... and I'm, I'm going to die." She wanted to cry. "Why didn't I just die from the fall... this is cruel, too cruel."
</p>
<p>With the two suns perched high above, without cover or water, it wouldn't take long. "What is the point of this!" she cried out.</p>
<p>
  <i>"What will kill me first?"</i> She wondered, weeping at the thought of never seeing Volare again, but o tears came, as if her body knew it couldn't spare the moisture. Her skin felt tight, pulled in different directions, it felt dry
  too, crisp, cooking under the two suns. There was nothing covering this Verido's face now, the scarf had gone in the fall and there was no way to move any limb because of the pain. There would be no point to that though, why bother to do
  anything that would prolong this life? Lupin lay in a place few traveled, only those on the backs of beasts or aboard vehicles could manage it, and it was dangerous to do even then. Not many waterlillies grew here, meaning there was no
  water, and therefore no life or chance of pulling through.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> came to mind then. "Things are changing. Pft! Things are ending is more like it."</p>
<p>
  While falling Lupin had decided it was okay to die, but now it didn't feel okay. When another storm came, this body would be buried in sand. If someone walked over the mound they wouldn't notice that there was a body there, a body with a
  story. Lupin would disappear forever.
</p>
<p><i>"Let me tell you the story of Lupin, who liked books, jokes and looma roots! Oh what a story it is! Lupin became Voice, and then fell off the Ilk. The end."</i></p>
<p><i>"What a legacy."</i> Lupin thought. Then this mind became tired of thinking, so tired. Maybe it was time...</p>
<p>to let go, to let go...</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>"The seeds, we sow, we sow."</i></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Lupin awoke again to a pained body and more sorrowful thoughts; though, at this point, even the brain had too little energy and will to conjure up anything.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>"The leaves, they grow, they grow."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The song came easy — no effort required. It was a pleasant tune, the only thing tethering this mind to the earth.</p>
<p>
  The Verido's tired eyes opened then, for a last time, to see the world alight before the darkness took over. Lupin's cheek was flat on the sand, looking skyward was impossible, but then these eyes found something moving in the distance.
</p>
<p><i>"An Ilk? No. Smaller than an Ilk, but big. Very big."</i></p>
<p>
  The figure was coming this way – was this a trick of the desert? A side-effect of land sickness? The closer it came, the more details came into view. A rider. Tall. Sitting atop a furry beast. They appeared enormous from afar, and even
  more so up close. The immense rider disembarked and walked over, holding a blue scarf, it looked tiny there lying between a set of thick digits. A pair of heavy knees touched the sand floor to be closer to Lupin; even when kneeling, the
  stranger's head towered high above, obscuring one of the two suns.
</p>
<p>“Hello Lupin of Volare,” the rider said.</p>
<p>
  This being was a giant, with short, dark hair; eyes like silver marbles and sharp facial contours – an otherworldly creature. The giant wore a yellow robe, like a flowing mass of sand, it covered a set of dark garments; the robe, if
  standing on its own, could serve to shelter a fair-sized group of people. The most impressive detail was the height of this being. Thin, with proportions that could dwarf most. Now, those silver orbs stared at Lupin's broken body.
</p>
<p>“How do you know my name?!” Lupin exclaimed, startled by the stranger's words.</p>
<p>“It’s written on your face,” the rider replied with a soft smile. “I’m <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a>, and I'm here to help."</p>
<p>The Verido was drifting off to sleep, or toward something more permanent. <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> put a hand on the side of Lupin's head then, "stay awake."</p>
<p>"Yes," Lupin mumbled, "I'm awake."</p>
<p>"You will be okay." The giant said in a commanding voice. "Look in the sky. <a href="lexicon.html#protus">Protus</a> is out. Name all of the <a href="lexicon.html#skyrock">skyrocks</a> that you know. Loud, so I can hear."</p>
<p>
  When Verido <a href="lexicon.html#leafling">leaflings</a> were young, they'd make a game of naming all of the known bodies in the sky. The names were difficult, so anyone who could remember them all was pronounced 'skyrock expert' and won
  the game. The majority of the <a href="lexicon.html#skyrocks">skyrocks</a> were not visible to the naked eye; <a href="lexicon.html#leafling">leaflings</a> were certain they were up there, the elders assured them that they were.
</p>
<p>
  "There are many things we cannot see, like the wind, yet, no one doubts it exists." No one knew who had named them, it was a story passed on through generations. These names had been written into stories after that, making them popular.
  Protus was one of the moons circling this planet, the only one in view now. <a href="lexicon.html#encela">Encela</a> was another, but these two were the easy ones. Lupin knew a lot of the names, but this tired brain would have to work
  extra hard to remember them. "Baladavos–"
</p>
<p>A fear gripped Lupin then. Was <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> here to carry this body into the next world?</p>
<p>"Cencitris, Naxagorus–"</p>
<p>
  This giant could be the embodiment of death, or a hallucination – also fever-induced. There was a chance that the pain was so grand that it brought forth these visions, this was the best explanation, any rational person would come to this
  conclusion too. In a moment, these colourful visions of <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> and the beast would vanish from the world, and the darkness would–
</p>
<p>"Liminik, Omoretus–"</p>
<p>They didn't vanish. Thinking about these <a href="lexicon.html#skyrock">skyrocks</a> seemed to keep this mind occupied, away from the allure of sleep.</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> began unfastening sheets of rolled fabric from the beast's back, all the while humming a tune, a soothing song, that reverberated all the way down into Lupin's core. The tune helped to quiet the pain.
</p>
<p>"Retna, Alpaninsis–"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> pulled out some long poles and put up a tent, then layed out a vibrant orange carpet inside it. Another bag lay strapped to the furry creature's side, Uno grabbed it and began to unload its contents,
  which consisted of a collection of herbs, a small kettle, mugs, some grains, plates, a crate of <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a> and a bag-full of other items.
</p>
<p>Not long after that,<a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> walked back over to Lupin, smiling. "You're only missing Aristollo."</p>
<p>"I've never won the <a href="lexicon.html#skyrock">skyrock</a> game." Lupin breathed.</p>
<p>"Everyone forgets Aristollo." <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> said.</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> scooped the Verido's body up with ease, and carried it inside the tent; once there, came time to take care of the wounds. Lupin's fear of <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> did not linger, evident
  strength aside, this being was gentle. Every motion was slow and calculated, producing little to no sound.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Lupin slept for a long while, <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> stayed close, sitting at an arm's reach. While the patient rested, the stranger read through a pile of ratty-looking books, a thick finger rapidly tracing from the top to
  bottom of every page. The rest of the time, <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> was cooking and caring for Lupin's wounds, the giant did leave the tent every now and again, but not for long. A series of naps divided the Verido's days, at
  every wakeful moment <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> had a different book in hand, the pages were full of annotations, notes and scribbles. One of the books read: "A tale of 3", Lupin saw a drawing of Volare markings in one of its
  margins. When asked about it, all <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> said was that keeping records of what one sees was important. Before the interrogation could continue, there came a wave of fatigue, the body and the mind agreed that it
  was time for another rest.
</p>
<p>“You look better,” <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> said one morning, offering a cup of <a href="lexicon.html#lemonilime">lemoni lime</a> tea.</p>
<p>Lupin nodded. “Yea. Part of me does anyway." The body was healing, but the mind needed some more time.</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> understood this. "Everything heals, in time."</p>
<p>"You don't have anywhere to be? I feel bad to keep you here like this."</p>
<p>"It's no problem. Take as long as you like."</p>
<p>
  Now that they'd spent some time together, the other-worldly veil had dissipated. <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> was quiet, and did not always care to answer questions, but declined them politely always. There are things that Lupin
  wanted to know, to understand, but after a few weeks asking seemed pointless. It was hard to get the giant's attention most times, as if <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a>'s mind was adrift up there. Lupin noticed after a while, that
  after reading books, <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> was more responsive, more present. Maybe that's why there were so many.
</p>
<p>Lupin had asked about this once. "Why do you carry so many books?"</p>
<p>"Times passes, and I forget. It's important not to forget," was all <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> had said.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Like every other morning they'd spent together, the giant served tea, a mixture of <a href="lexicon.html#medililly">medililly</a> and <a href="lexicon.html#lemonilime">lemoni lime</a> herbs. "Great for circulation,"
  <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> would say. On this morning, <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> seemed especially aware of the surrounding environment, and after serving tea, silver eyes scanned the skies and the horizon, before
  stopping upon a mountain.
</p>
<p>“Drink your tea. You need to be in good shape, especially if you are to climb a mountain," <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> said with a grin.</p>
<p>“A mountain?” Lupin didn't understand. The wounds had healed over, and some strength had returned, but climbing a mountain? This was not something one who suffered a great injury could do, not so soon.</p>
<p>“Yes. That one.” A long finger pointed to a tall mountain in the distance, a thick layer of clouds obscured it's upper half. “All the way to the top of it too.”</p>
<p>
  Had <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> lost all reason? It was hard to tell. The tall being spoke in such a calm and authoritative voice, it inspired confidence, a voice like that could not lie. If those silvery eyes found you, Lupin
  believed, they had the power to lull you into doing almost anything. It's like they could see past the layers of flesh and muscle, they had a direct line to your brain, and these words, were a reflection of your innermost thoughts and
  feelings. <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> would never make anyone do anything outside of their character though, nothing contrary to their desires. This being was the enabler, your inner-voice in the flesh. Everyone would agree that
  this mountain-climbing ordeal was crazy though. This Verido did think that <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> had everyone's best interest at heart, but this didn't make sense.
</p>
<p>
  “Yea? Why would I do that.” With eyes now set on the mountain, Lupin wondered, had it always been there? The shape of it seemed familiar, yet no name came to mind. Vol had passed here many times, surely someone would have noticed it
  there. It was like it had always been invisible, that is, until <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> had mentioned it.
</p>
<p>
  “It occurred to me that I haven’t presented you to my friend,” <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> said, walking out of the tent, "come!" Lupin felt too weak to stand, but <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> would hear nothing of it.
  “Come!” Very few possessed the strength to dismiss the words of a living god. Lupin groaned, and managed to stand up. These legs did not like to support the combined weight of a torso, limbs and a head, it was like trying to keep balance
  on a pair of wobbly stilts. Street performers could do it much better, with no sweat at their brow. Panicked hands grabbed onto anything they could, pulling the rest of the body over to the entrance of the tent. Those hands found a solid
  perch there, fingers locking around one of the poles holding up the tent, then came time to look for that friend <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> had mentioned.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> presented the friend at once, “Lupin, meet <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a>.” Images of a tall rider sitting atop a beast resurfaced then, there had been someone else.
  <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a> was a large big-eared creature - no doubt it could hear things small-eared folks could not. It had light-coloured fur, with what looked like spots of ink spattered about its body. Two darker spots sat
  over its eyes, giving an air of severity and general discontent.
</p>
<p>"A <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a>? Thought those were extinct."</p>
<p>
  It occurred to Lupin then, that like the mountain with no name, <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> felt familiar somehow. There was a story, one that Pumra read to leaflings during town feasts, while the adults were busy. The story spoke
  of the tall ones, beings of great height, in the early days of the world, they towered above the clouds and spent much time admiring the passing comets and planets. They spent all their time looking upwards, but then one day, a comet
  landed at their feet and they averted their gaze ground-ward. Both began to watch the sandstorms form, and dissipate, then, came life. The comet had brought some foreign organisms, greenery, sprouting from the ground, the tall ones were
  completely absorbed by it, they watched it grow and spread. They spent so much time looking down with knees bent, that they began to shrink, and just like that, the tiny things of the world became more important than the big things. They
  became the first growers, and sowed life of their own across the desert, it was a famous story, they were "the guardians of the world". Lupin and <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> spent much time arguing over the texts, "Foolish
  stories, for fools like you!" <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> had said once. "If there was anyone that tall out there, we would have seen them." <a href="lexicon.html#mago">Mago</a> wasn't wrong about that. Giants could not hide, why
  would anything that tall want to conceal itself anyway?
</p>
<p>
  In the book, there had been sketches, one was of a tall being, thin with clear eyes and dark hair. "It's you" Lupin mumbled, eyes fixed on some distant, non-existing thing. The world was a very different sort of place now, there was so
  much to know and discover, but unlike the story suggested, Lupin did not think that they had created the world or its inhabitants, that was due to some other more complex process. The thought of ageless giants did raise some questions,
  not to mention it defied all logic. Speaking of logic, being an ageless giant, meant knowing the knowledge of centuries. <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> reading Verido markings did not seem so far-fetched now, it was not so difficult
  to imagine that someone long ago, had imparted this skill.
</p>
<p>
  Then, without warning, Lupin could not draw breath, it was like the air had vanished from the world. Nothing in the environment had changed, what this was, was awe. It was a rare thing, to be awestruck. Now, standing in front of this
  being, this living illogical thing, Lupin found breath again, and the laughs came, and they would not stop! Every organ ached with laughter, is this what Volare felt when first gazing upon the Ilk? A ridiculous and continuous stream of
  emotions, all contrary to each other? It was like one's own body was losing control! The brain, unable to produce the right sort of reaction, due to the grand and immense complexity of the scene, would flip all the switches on at once and
  hope for the best. "Ah, dry mouth," Lupin mumbled, yet another addition to the growing list of uncontrollable symptoms, of being awestruck.
</p>
<p>"Tell me what you know of the early days of the world," the Verido said suddenly, eyes full of wonder.</p>
<p>
  When hearing those words, <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> laughed, <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a>'s ears perked up at the sound, and proceeded to nuzzle its master. The laughs died off, but <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a>'s face
  still bore a large smile. This reaction did not confirm or deny it, the rest of the day, Lupin spent watching the ageless giant. The head did not reach the clouds, maybe it would again soon, maybe the happenings at ground level were of
  more interest? This was a pleasing thought, to think that such a being would rather live amongst the small. Lupin tried to imagine what other sort of people and creatures walked this world, it’s like <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> and
  <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a> had awoken a newfound curiosity, a thirst for exploration and adventure. This Verido of Volare was entering a world thought to only exist in books, but those words, had taken solid shape. Falling off the
  Ilk wasn’t so terrible now, there was so much to do and see. The nameless mountain came to mind then.
</p>
<p>"I’m going to climb you.”</p>
<p>The next day, Lupin shared this intention with <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a>, who smiled, and denied ever having introduced the idea in the first place.</p>
<p>“Good idea."</p>
<hr />
<p>
  They spent a few more weeks together, until Lupin was at near full strength. <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> packed up the patterned carpet and fabric, the herbs and <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a> too. With
  everything packed onto <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a>, they looked like true world travellers. <a href="lexicon.html#kit">Kit</a> was strong and could stand to have all this stuff as well as the weight of a rider. Before they parted
  ways, <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> presented a copy of "The tale of 3" and handed it to Lupin.
</p>
<p>
  “For you,” the book was bound beautifully. "I transcribed it from an original, it's all true, all about your people. You may enjoy it." There was another gift too, but like the scarf, it already belonged to the Verido. The gift was
  Lupin's safety chute, the Verido had forgotten all about it, it had failed early on during the fall. The chute was taken apart and rolled up tight, it was now the size of a small loaf of bread. "Salvaged this for you, it was torn badly, I
  mended it. Fabric is hard to come by in these parts. You can use it for shelter." <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> also gave the 4 crossbars, these could also be used to give the shelter a proper shape.
</p>
<p>
  “Thank you.” Lupin presented a gift too, <a href="lexicon.html#levi">Levi</a>'s blue scarf, "My <a href="lexicon.html#mapa">mapa</a> did tell me I would need it long, maybe it's because it was meant to be yours."
  <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> accepted it, with many thanks said. It appeared tiny on <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a>'s neck, the piece of fabric could not go a full two turns around it, so the giant wrapped it around once, and
  made a knot to hold it in place. This being took a liking to it straight away, large hands carefully rearranged the knot again, as if handling the petals of a flower.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a> climbed up on Kit’s back then, the motion of the giant's cape sent a flurry of sand flying around them.</p>
<p>
  “Aristollo was named after an <a href="lexicon.html#iridi">Iridi</a>. Ask about it if you speak to one, it's a good story. It may help you remember it in the future.” The giant said this, right before Kit bounded up high and far into the
  horizon.
</p>
<p>
  Lupin waved at the illogical giant, the one who looked down and extracted that sad, broken, pile of a creature from its deathbed. A thought came to mind then too, perhaps this body chose to fall off <a href="lexicon.html#vol">Vol</a>'s
  back, heavy with ambition and eager to see the world. It was silly to think such things, this Verido knew better. Like <a href="lexicon.html#rosmus">Rosmus</a> purposely chose to not be a <a href="lexicon.html#reader">Reader</a>, Lupin
  fell, having chosen not to learn how to tie decent knots.
</p>
