<h1>The Sandfin</h1>
<h2>— Chapter 4 —</h2>
<img src="../media/content/flora.cactub.jpg" />
<p>Eka, Lupin and Hush wandered the desert, quenching their thirst with waterstones. Hush could no longer stand any weight on its back and walked behind them, panting. They could not get to Montore fast enough, though the thought of cake and tea did offer some motivation. During the walk, Eka sang about bam cakes, listing the ingredients aloud in song. Every song ended with a solo of groans and growls, courtesy of Lupin’s empty belly.</p>
<p><em>“Ba-ba-ba-bam cakes! Ba-ba-ba-bam cakes!”</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="bam-cakes-recipe">Bam Cakes Recipe</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>700 plbs bams</em></li>
<li><em>2 may leaves</em></li>
<li><em>2 avoka nuts</em></li>
<li><em>350 plbs nutshroos</em></li>
<li><em>115 plbs bobonions</em></li>
<li><em>8 plbs dilly herbs</em></li>
<li><em>50 plbs teaweet flour</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove skins from bams, and dice into cubes. Boil with a may leaf until soft. While bams are softening, crack one avoka nut in a pan and sautee diced bonions and chopped nutshroos. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated, then let brown for an extra 5 minutes. Chop the dilly herbs, add to pan with nutshroos. Mix together and take off heat.</li>
<li>Drain bams, mash with a stone mortar and let cool. Add teaweet flour to mashed bams. Take a handful of bams dough and flatten into a disk, add some nutshroo mix into the center and cover with more bam dough. Crack another avoka oil in a pan, and fry for 5 minutes until golden, flip, and repeat.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>“Please stop singing about food.” Lupin said.</p>
<p>They’d tried to ration the teaweet bread, but Hush raided their stores in the night and all 5 loaves had already been eaten, and digested. Eka and Lupin had to suck on waterstones, it helped in the absence of food as they could draw out the water in economical doses.</p>
<p>“We’re going to die out here.” Lupin said, groaning.</p>
<p>Eka did not share Lupin’s concerns. “Haven’t you ever been in the desert before? There is always something to eat or drink.”</p>
<p>“Verido don’t walk on the ground,” Lupin said, every mention of the word ‘eat’ was the stomach’s cue to start whining again, “if what you’re saying is true, then why aren’t we finding anything?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s too hot!”</p>
<p>“Of course, only <em>idiots</em> would be out here in this heat.”</p>
<p>“OH the things you say Lew, it’s like you’re not of this world! When night comes we should be able to find some.”</p>
<p>Lupin mumbled some words under breath, if anyone wasn’t of this world it was Eka. It was true that this Verido, despite having read many books, did not know much of the desert.</p>
<p>They had not travelled together long, but the Verido knew already that Eka did not like to explain things. They walked for some time, and then stopped in a spot that looked no different than anywhere else… to the untrained eye.</p>
<p>“We’ll set camp here.”</p>
<p>Lupin was too tired and too hungry to complain. And so, using the chute, they built a makeshift tent.</p>
<hr />
<p>Come nightfall, Eka waited outside it, staring at the ground.</p>
<p>“Lew. Pssst! LEW! Come here.”</p>
<p>Lupin groaned, rolling over to Eka outside. The fabric of the chute wasn’t very big, it didn’t make a proper shelter at all, just a small canopy under which they could lie. A lot of it was already filled with Hush’s gigantic head, but the beast could not be persuaded to move. “What is it?”</p>
<p>Red pointed over to a collection of little stems pushing out of the soil, a fan of leaves opened up at the ends.</p>
<p>“Take the one closest to you,” Eka whispered.</p>
<p>Lupin went to grab it, but all of the fanned stems went to hide back into the soil.</p>
<p>“You’re terrible at this.”</p>
<p>“This? I have no idea what <strong>THIS</strong> is!”</p>
<p>“Lower your voice,” Eka commanded, "and be still. When the stems come back out and the leaves open up, clap your hands together real fast. It’ll stun them, and you can grab one. Haven’t you ever harvested cactubs before?</p>
<p>“No,” Lupin said. “What’s a cactub?”</p>
<p>Eka laughed. “Only the best vegetable ever. I’ll do it. Watch me.”</p>
<p>Like before, the cactub stems emerged, and the leaves opened up in a fan. Eka neared two hands to one of them, and then…</p>
<p><strong>CLAP!</strong></p>
<p>Red grabbed the stem and pulled it out. The cactub was a bulbous root vegetable, purple and covered in little round nubs. They peeled the skin off, and ate slices of it for dinner. Cactub was soft and sweet on the inside, and had many seeds.</p>
<p>“You can eat these too, or toss them. They’ll grow back from the seed if you do that. For every two I eat, I toss one,” saying this, Eka tossed one seed over the left shoulder.</p>
<p>“Eat one-” Lupin said, chewing on a seed, “-toss one!” The other found its way back into the earth. They did this for a long while, smiling with every mention of <em>‘eat one’</em> and <em>‘toss one.’</em></p>
<p>Now with food in their bellies, they huddled-in together to stay warm and to try to get some sleep. Their bodies ached, keeping them all very much awake. Eka looked at the sky and the stars, a finger tracing along the visible constellations and calling them by name.</p>
<p>“Salarus, Vitali, Neoneve…”</p>
<p>These names Eka recited every night before bed. The finger fell upon another star in the distance, lying low, and brighter than all others. A false star. It had taken some time for Lupin to doze off, Eka knew this but couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>“LEW! Something! Over there!”</p>
<p>Lupin turned to look, long-faced and red-eyed. “It’s late. We’ll check it out in the morning.”</p>
<p>Eka had no intention of postponing this discovery. “Fine, you stay. I’ll be back.” Halfway through the sentence Eka was up and racing towards the point of light in the dark.</p>
<p>Lupin didn’t like this idea at all. In part because somewhere within, lived a fear that the Wonder would leave and never return. This Verido had lost too much already, and decided to get up to chase Red. It was easy to spot that wild head of hair in the dark. They arrived at the low star, which turned out to be a light affixed to the stern of a vessel, it lay on its side half-buried in the sand.</p>
<p>“It’s a sandfin!” Lupin said circling it, making out the details of it in the dark was difficult. The hull was red, and flat-bottomed. Then Eka pointed to one of the portholes, there was the faint glow of a light. Someone was inside.</p>
<p>“Who’s in there?” Lupin called out, knocking on the hull.</p>
<p>A thin-eyed, short thing, came peering out of one of the portholes.</p>
<p>“Waran di! Nono is fearsome! Away! AWAY youuuuu!” a shrill voice said.</p>
<p>The creature stuck its face in the porthole, it contoured its large head perfectly. It looked like the sandfin had a face growing out of its side. The creature was a Finiku, large-eared with a wide flat face. The Finiku’s hair was light and wild, not a single strand seemed to point in the same direction, all, except for a chunk of hair fused together. It was covered in pinny tar and coiled in a thick braid. Pinny tar was a thick, black substance used to protect ropes on a sandfin. The Finiku’s hands too were stained with it, from handling ropes all day. Eka giggled, and watched as Lupin approached the porthole so the Finiku could see better. Even when standing close, still, the sandfinner’s eyes looked everywhere but in the right place.</p>
<p>“Specters! WARAN DI! Ahh how Nono be in Ash Plain? Nono noonsight it be no good! NO good!”</p>
<p>“What? No. This is the central rim. We’re fleshy people. We’re right in front of you! Can’t you see us?” Lupin asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>“Too dark, too dark!” The Finiku replied, disappearing below. They could hear noises, as the owner of the vessel searched the cabin for something. Then a beam of light flashed in Lupin’s face. “Hmm. A Verido in sand? No. Fleshy? No no no, you no be a fleshy. And aaaa—?” The owner of the sandfin moved the light around, searching for whoever this fictional Verido was with.</p>
<p>“An Eka! Yora’nae Nono!” Eka said with a smirk, moving into the light.</p>
<p>“Friendly?”</p>
<p>Eka nodded. “Friendly and fleshy”</p>
<p>“I’m fleshy too. I’m a ground-dwelling Verido now.” Saying these things made Lupin uncomfortable and opted to change conversation, “your sandfin needs some repairs?”</p>
<p>The Finiku, that they came to know as Nono, explained to them what had happened. “Sandfin okay, but it no more move!” Nono’s eyes widened saying this, they were unusually clear and sickly-looking. Lupin saw there was plenty of light in the cabin, yet the sandfinner claimed to see nothing.</p>
<p>“Right. Well, come daytime we’ll help you fix it.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The next morning, Nono emerged from the cabin and stood on deck. Lupin was up already, in truth, sleep had not come because of last night’s events. Finikus had a unique physique, they were short pot-bellied creatures with long droopy ears. Those clear sick eyes were disturbing, it was likely that Nono suffered from a bad case of cataracts. Eka too arrived at the foot of the sandfin, waving hello to its captain.</p>
<p>“Ara ara! Body is—how you say this in common tongue? ‘Bigger’. Da na?” Nono said, standing right near the hyroo and getting ready to shake hands with it. Hush let out a long whoop.</p>
<p>Eka laughed. “This is Hush, was asleep last night during our introduction.”</p>
<p>“I see, I see! Yora’nae Hush!”</p>
<p>“See? Are you sure you CAN see?” Lupin asked mockingly, that Finiku’s eyes definitely had a problem.</p>
<p>Now that light fell upon the vessel, they could see that it was damaged. The sandfin lay over a rocky patch and the rudder was ripped out. Most of the hull looked alright, but the area where the rudder had been had a large gaping hole. Nono leapt off the side of the yacht, and went to stand with the others to look at the wreckage. The captain stood 3 heads shorter than they. “Is light kink! Oh whyyyyy it no move?!”</p>
<p>“A kink? You serious?” Lupin said, outraged. “There’s a giant hole there at the back of it!”</p>
<p>“Iana, iana. No hole. Verido crazy from landsick.”</p>
<p>Nono’s eyes narrowed down to try and see the hole, then Lupin arrived and helped the Finiku closer. “Big one. Right there!” Lupin said. The Finiku was un-phased by the damage. It was only with a nose up to it that Nono noticed it. “Iana, iana, iana.” Nono’s head shook from side to side, there was no stopping it. Eka went to stand closer, as if to offer moral support, and even laid a hand over the Finiku’s shoulder to try to steady that tottering head.</p>
<p>“You have materials on board?” Eka asked.</p>
<p>Nono nodded, the shaking of the head had ceased then too. “Finiku’wati be ready, always ready! We make rudder. No problem! I have material, all we need!”</p>
<hr />
<p>Once all 3 got to work, Lupin realized just how terrible Nono’s vision was. “No one in their right mind would allow someone so blind to captain a ship,” Lupin told Eka, who just smirked, busy gathering materials from inside the cabin. Together, they devised a plan to build the sandfin a new rudder. They removed bits of the old one and took measurements. They drew a rough shape on a piece of banabo wood, a surface normally used as a table. Lupin found a hacksaw stashed under a pile of spare lines, it was made of thin but strong metal, “says ‘Maka’ on the handle.”</p>
<p>“Renate steel!” Nono said, “siri de yorala!”</p>
<p>“Best in the land,” Eka translated.</p>
<p>Each had their own task to perform. Lupin cut the banabo board for the paddle, Eka was shaving the skin from an old oar to make the rudder post, and Nono was busy retrieving bolts and nuts that would fit it. The cabin was filled with tools and spares, there was no space to sit. “Where do you sleep?” Eka asked. “Table, good bed” Nono replied.</p>
<p>“How about sleeping in an actual bed instead?” Lupin asked.</p>
<p>“Ahh iana iana,” Nono began, “last time Nono sleep in bed, find some metal in skin!” Saying this, the Finiku showed the marks they had left behind. Lupin gasped, noticing there was another bit of stray metal in there still.</p>
<p>“Sou ya di naa…” Nono said with a sigh. “Embarrassing. Please ignore.” Even the table was not free of dangers.</p>
<p>All continued their work. Lupin was fascinated by the sandfin, they were a common sight while travelling on the Ilk. The winged vessels looked tiny from up there, the colour of their sails and the dust rising with their passing was all Lupins could make out.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Lupin asked, pointing to a metallic barrel stored on deck, “plumpkin juice?”</p>
<p>“Best renewable and combustible matter in the central rim,” Eka said, reading the name of the product on the barrel, written in Finiku letters.</p>
<p>“Kaka.” Nono said. “Poop,” Eka said, seeing the look on Lupin’s face and laughing.</p>
<p>Lupin had heard of this, but did not think it to be true. Nono explained that while the sandfin had no need of fuel there was always a barrel stored on this vessel to give to others. “Montore fiendlings say it ‘miracle substance’, make life easy easy! Why use hand when there is machine they say. Fiendlings sell this dream to Finiku, give machine… but what happen when it break? They have no part, no fuel. Beobug come fix, ask for coin! Beobug create— how you say? Dependency. Da na? Before, Finiku depend only on sawa and kira!”</p>
<p>“Wind and sun.” Lupin said. “I don’t understand what Ilk ‘kaka’ has to do with fuel.” Lupin said, perplexed.</p>
<p>“Beobug sandfin, it follow Ilk and take kaka! Then, Beobug process kaka on sandfin. Very profitable business, very profitable! Nono mapa say, ‘If Nono captain Beobug sandfin, Nono would make good coin!’” Nono’s head shook again, “Mapa say this, but Nono is like grand-mapa Etyl, care only to sandfin. Nono listen to voice of sawa and kira. Coin be cold. Mawani iana oro.” Nono said, putting a hand on the heart. “No soul.”</p>
<p>“Etyl is your grand-mapa?” Eka asked. “That name is known all over! First one to travel the whole of the land by sandfin!” Nono nodded. “Ora ora! Did it alone too!”</p>
<p>They completed the construction of their make-shift rudder and put it back into place, they also began work on patching up that hole around it. All the while, listening to stories of Etyl and the early days of sandfinning.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a day of hard work,Nono tested out the rudder and saw no problem with it. Nono couldn’t believe it. The hull was missing paint, but was otherwise immaculate.</p>
<p>“Now, make delivery to Tiputa. Nono offer ride! Come aboard fleshy!”</p>
<p>Lupin and Eka were happy to join the crew, Nono didn’t mind Hush coming along too and said that the sandfin could use the extra weight at the stern.</p>
<p>They unfurled the sails and set course for Tiputa, plowing through the sand and leaving a golden cloud in their wake. The sandfin was running downwind, with two blue wings pulling it along. The wind freshened, and the sands began to blow hard but handling a vessel with two more aboard was easy. Eka made sure the sails had a good shape, while Lupin kept an eye on the horizon, there was no trusting Nono’s eyes. The two crew members helped with navigation, making sure to avoid patches of hard soil. Nono&lt; had no sense of direction, and kept mistaking dunes for other sandfins. Despite these handicaps, Nono was confident and blamed it all on bad light.</p>
<p>One night the Finiku offered to make dinner, serving them something that stank of pomparu. Lupin joked that dinner had probably been scraped off of the hull, their pained stomachs agreed with this theory.</p>
<p>Lupin asked about other sandfinners, Nono knew many, “Ora! But they is not so good.” The shock of this reply caused a chunk of looma root to lodge itself in the Verido’s throat. After a few coughs and gasps, the piece flew across the cabin and onto the wall. If Nono was the best sandfinner, Lupin’s mind conjured up images of sandfins in piles lining a city, hulls kinked-up and full of holes with Nonos at the wheel. All were sickly-eyed and yelling out orders while pressing a crew—that had long since mutinied—to get under way. The worse of it being that these sure-footed captains, were unaware of the fact that their vessels lay broken and unmoving. “Just a kink!” They all said in unison.</p>
<p>Nono had brief moments of clarity, noting changes in the landscape with surprising accuracy. The crew thought it strange, surely there was no such thing as a condition that would better and worsen itself at random like this. Eka did not want to believe that Nono was a bad sandfinner. They spent a lot of time together on the vessel, and after a while they noticed a pattern. Nono’s vision was especially bad after drinking from the water stone tank. To extract the water out of the stones there was a foot pump in the galley, the pump would press the stones down, the water was then funnelled down a tube and would come out of a tap in the sink. Eka and Lupin still used their personal stock of stones for water, and so one morning they opened the tank. It was full of mudbears, tiny insects that burrow in waterstones and that ooze a substance that contaminates the water inside. Nono had been drinking bad water this whole time. The spoiled tank was the cause of their captain’s recurring bouts of blurry vision and disorientation. Eka offered the Finiku waterstones from their supply, and after drinking from a good source the symptoms wore off. After Nono’s eyes cleared up, Eka went ahead and showed the contents of the tank.</p>
<p>“Sou ya di! Good it is that Nono meet Eka and Lupin!”</p>
<p>Lupin was against handing the tiller over at first, but Eka explained that the sickness was to blame and that all Finiku were fantastic sandfinners. This was a fact, everyone knew this, many were born and raised in those vessels. It was in their klorea.</p>
<p>They arrived at their destination within a few days time. Nono thanked them for their help.</p>
<p>“Nono fill waterstone tank in Kippu. It clean Kippuans tell Nono, but not so… not so. Maybe Nono go back and help Kippu’wati, bad eyes is not so good, da na?”</p>
