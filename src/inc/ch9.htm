<p>
  "I really couldn't let you in, not without identification." A young <a href="lexicon.html#aodal">Aodal</a> said, standing behind a desk equipped with bars, as if to protect the desk clerk from physical harm. This should have given Lupin
  some hint as to what sort of town <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> was, a place with rules and procedures, something that can drive even the calmest of persons up a wall.
</p>
<p>"We don't have that in <a href="lexicon.html#volare">Volare</a>!" Lupin said, getting hot in the face.</p>
<p>"I see." The clerk reached for a pamphlet and handed it over to Lupin through an opening in the bars. The pamphlet read: <b>"So you don't exist."</b></p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>"If you want to exist in the eyes of <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> you need a piece of identification."</p>
<p>"A piece of identification that tells others who I am? That's stupid."</p>
<p>
  "It's the law." The clerk reached under the desk and pulled up a <a href="lexicon.html#durdle">durdle</a>, a creature with long ears and a spiked shell, it had a tag stuck to one of its spikes with the writing 'd-126'. "See. Even d-126
  here has an ID."
</p>
<p>"Okay. Fine. Say I want to get an ID, where do I get it?"</p>
<p>"You'll need to visit the next stall <a href="lexicon.html#specter">Specter</a>. NEXT!" The clerk called, eager to move on to another customer.</p>
<p>
  Lupin stormed off, looking for that next stall the clerk had mentioned. It was easy to find, it being the one with a long line of people standing in front of it. A long, long line, snaking around
  <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>'s outer wall and through an amassments of tents. Lupin approached a young <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> who stood in line with a question, "hey, how long you been waiting here?"
</p>
<p>The <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> appeared to be in a daze. "Forever... maybe. Who caaaares!" The <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>'s voice was sluggish.</p>
<p>"Yuna's been in line for 5 days" said a voice behind Lupin, it came from another <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> who also stood in line.</p>
<p>"That long? For an ID?"</p>
<p>"Yep, it's a good job! Pays well."</p>
<p>"I don't understand."</p>
<p>
  "Someone's paying us to wait in line for them, they're staying in one of those tents out there. When I reach the desk we switch places and I get paid! There's always people willing to pay not to wait. They get what they want, we get what
  we want, it's perfect."
</p>
<p>Lupin estimated that it would take at least 1 week to reach the front desk, "hell of a life..."</p>
<p>"Only way I can afford <a href="lexicon.html#kavava">Kavava</a> root. I just ran out actually, the next couple of days are going to suck."</p>
<p>"Is that what that other <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> is on?"</p>
<p>"Yuna? Yea. Every surrogate in this line is here for Kavava."</p>
<p>
  Lupin turned to Yuna again, the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> appeared to be in another world, body swaying slowly from side to side, "That's not a life. I had a friend in my village who slept most of the time and this is really
  no different."
</p>
<p>"Everyone who hasn't tried kavava says that, you don't know what you're talking about."</p>
<p>Lupin frowned then and was about to leave but then asked another question. "I was wondering, do you know a <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>?"</p>
<p>"If I know a <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>?"</p>
<p>"A <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>, like you. Friend to me."</p>
<p>"OH I see how it is, we all know each other is that it?"</p>
<p>"Is that a no?"</p>
<p>
  "You really need to chill. I think you'd be happier on Kavava, has a way of making everything okay," the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> laughed at this, then seeing the look on the stranger's face decided to say the truth. "Every
  <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> knows about <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>. Has something of great value I hear, many go out into the desert everyday to look for that fabled patch of green, but it's dangerous, most never
  make it — I bet you know that though, being friend to <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>! If you know the location and tell the guards I bet you could get an ID real fast."
</p>
<p>Lupin wouldn't dream of betraying <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>, especially not to anyone from <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>, not with a field-full of younglings.</p>
<p>"There's a guard right there, see? HEY! Hey YOU! Guard person!"</p>
<p>
  Lupin wanted to run away, but the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> gripped the Verido's collar and kept Lupin in place. The guard, an <a href="lexicon.html#aodal">Aodal</a>, moved towards them, a tall creature, dressed in the greens
  of <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>. <a href="lexicon.html#aodal">Aodal</a>s are the tallest of desert habitants, second only to <a href="lexicon.html#uno">Uno</a>, Lupin thought then. They are strong, brown-skinned with thin
  eyes and pointed ears. This guard bared these features too, with dark hair combed neatly, to better fit under a green <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> cap.
</p>
<p>
  "I wish you wouldn't call me guard person," the guard said, offended by this. "I've got a name you know, I'm not just some faceless duplicate!" Lupin spied the name on the piece of ID, hanging from the guard's chest, it read '
  <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a>'.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> smirked, turning to Lupin, "<a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> here has a fear of being perceived as ordinary."</p>
<p>
  "I've got grand ideas, there are plenty of things I want to do with my life! This is not my forever job you know, I am most definitely NOT going to spend my life making sure kakava addicts like you don't fall down a ditch."
  <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> said, red in the face.
</p>
<p>"The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek," Lupin said.</p>
<p>Both <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> and <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> turned to the Verido then, as if they'd forgotten why they were all here.</p>
<p>"Why is this one speaking in riddles," <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> asked.</p>
<p>"That quote is a famous Balandrian writer!" Lupin corrected.</p>
<p>"This one knows the whereabouts of <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>!" <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> then said, tugging at <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a>'s sleeve.</p>
<p>Lupin tried to deny it all, "I'm just a traveling potter, i make pots! I don't know anything about anything! Well, I know about pots! But that's really IT!"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> knocked on the side of Lupin's head with a fist, "this Verido is hiding something! Not a cave, but an oasis of green and boundless treasures. Isn't that right?" Whenever Lupin tried to tear away, the
  <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> found some other limb or piece of clothes to grab onto, then, suddenly a <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> fell out of one pocket and rolled onto the ground.
</p>
<p>
  Both the guard and <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> froze at the sight of it. "A <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>-" the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> said, releasing Lupin and going to grab the colourful piece of
  fruit instead. <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> held onto it, stroking the bumps on its surface gently, like stroking the head of a newgrown sprout. There was a hint of sadness in <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>'s eyes, the
  <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> put a nose to the fruit, smelling it and whispering into it. <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> then reached forward and tore it away, inspecting it from all angles. "A potter huh? Where did
  you get this?" A question aimed at Lupin, no doubt, although the guard's eyes were fixed on that fruit.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> went mad then, and leapt at the <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> to get it back; after getting a hold of it the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> ran away, grabbing Lupin's arm and darting
  into the crowd. The guard rushed after them, but soon lost sight of the two runaways...
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> stopped once they had gone far away enough, breathing hard, the <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> in hand.</p>
<p>"You lost your place in line," Lupin said, shocked. "Weeks of waiting-!"</p>
<p>"Doesn't matter," <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> replied, eyes on the fruit still. "You really were at that oasis."</p>
<p>Lupin hesitated at first, but nodded. "Yea, you thought I was kidding? This was a parting gift."</p>
<p>
  "<a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>s are extinct. You know that right? Thought the plant and seed had gone up in flames with the citadel and the rest. I love the smell of <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>s, warmed by the
  sun- some have tried to synthesize the smell and taste, but it's not the same. I forgot how fragrant it was, sweet, yet bitter."
</p>
<p>"You can have it," Lupin then said with a smile. "It's yours to eat."</p>
<p>
  "I love the smell, but I also kind of hate it, brings back certain memories I would have preferred to forget-" <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> then said, the <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> resting against the
  <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>'s cheek, fingers lightly bruising the surface, "if you know what i mean."
</p>
<p>
  Lupin knew why. After the <a href="lexicon.html#iridiraids">Iridi raids</a> and changes in the world the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>s had grown lethargic, abandoning their ways, they stopped growing food and lost their
  connection with the soil.
</p>
<p>
  "When I'm on kavava, the dichotomy, the dualism, just disappears. There's no opposite. Love is hate, and hate is love. This <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> is a <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> and I don't attribute
  anything else to it, it is neither delicious or disgusting." While talking, <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>'s eyes were set on that fruit, as if having a silent conversation with it. Then the
  <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> smiled, breaking out of that trance, throwing the fruit up in the air and then catching it again in mid-flight. "Why do you want to get into <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> anyway?"
</p>
<p>"<a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cake and tea."</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> laughed. "As good a reason as any. I'll get you an ID, I've got some connections."</p>
<hr />
<p>
  The next day, Lupin and Eka went to wait at the foot of the eastern wall, encircling the city. <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> had instructed Lupin to wait here, but now, was past their meeting time and their helper was a no-show.
  They wandered back over to the town entrance, making sure to avoid any guards, while keeping an eye open for <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>. By then, word about their presence and their possession of real
  <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>s had reached the ears of many other <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>s. Many of the ones standing in line for ID glanced at them as they walked past, "Hey!" One of them called out. "Is it
  true that you've met <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>?"
</p>
<p>Lupin hushed the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>. "Yes, yes — but keep your voice low."</p>
<p>"Got any more of those <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>s?"</p>
<p>Eka did have one left, but wasn't sure if it was a good idea to say so, these <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>s looked very eager.</p>
<p>"I'll get you an ID for one!" One <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> said. "I've got coin, you want coin for it?"</p>
<p>"Uh oh—" Eka said, noticing the amount of attention they were getting, some guards turned, tipped off by the many <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>s beginning to encircle them and shouting offers to them.</p>
<p>
  Then the Woth moved out of its glass ball, and reached into Eka's pack, pulling out the last <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>. The woth then took off with it, high and above everyone's head. Eka shouted another UH OH, "Hum hum
  come back!" The <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>s all stared at the brightly coloured fruit, jumping into the air to try and grab a hold of it, the guards saw it plainly now, and hurried over, but then they too began to try and take
  it. The woth just hovered outside of their reach, and then took off and flew inside of the city, flying over the main entrance. Many followed, rushing inside, the guards at the entrance too had left their post in an attempt to get their
  hands on it "<a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>!" "GET IT GET IT!" It was complete havoc, a horde was following the woth inside the city, even the desk clerk was there! Eka and Lupin were able to get inside, "That woth is
  brilliant!" Lupin said, "An first-class instigator of change! A genius!!" They'd made their way into the city, without <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>'s help and without ID.
</p>
<p>"CAKE AND TEA!" Lupin shouted, running inside.</p>
<p>Eka laughed. "You're going to start a riot!"</p>
<p>"I'm just a follower, the woth is the mastermind!"</p>
<p>
  The woth landed on top of a high building, setting the <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> on a visible and inaccessible place, and it's there that it waited as the people on the ground gathered round to look at the
  thought-be-extinct fruit.
</p>
<p>
  Eka and Lupin ran deeper into the city, past buildings and street vendors, until they arrived at the main plaza. The plaza was a flat clear space, encircled with tiny stalls with vendors selling a variety of flavored
  <a href="lexicon.html#foodstamps">foodstamps</a>.
</p>
<p>"Get your <a href="lexicon.html#bobonion">bobonion</a> soup patch here! Best in the city!"</p>
<p>"In the mood for some <a href="lexicon.html#mapple">mapple</a>s? Get the patch right here, right now!"</p>
<p>
  The floor of the city was dusty, with some debris here and there; some younger workers were there to catch every stray item, usually the left-over patches which inevitably found their way to the ground after use. The people of
  <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> threw them over their shoulders when they were done, mirroring the habit of throwing away remains of fresh fruits and vegetables. For such foods, throwing it on the ground was okay since it would
  come apart and disappear, the same couldn't be said of these stamps.
</p>
<p>"Where do the used stamps go?" Eka asked one of the younglings, who pointed to a building near the northern end of town, adjoined to the outerwall. "And what happens when it's full?"</p>
<p>The youngling cocked a head to one side, "I guess they'll put it in another building." Then another worker piped up, "maybe we can bury it!"</p>
<p>"There's no plan?" Eka asked, "why not eat real food instead? Real food doesn't have packaging."</p>
<p>The young workers made faces when hearing this, "Real food? But it comes out of the ground!" "It's so dirty!" Another said.</p>
<p>"You come out of the ground too y'know," Eka pointed out.</p>
<p>The young ones didn't know what to say to that, they looked themselves over, as if to make sure they didn't have dirt on them still.</p>
<p>
  Every house, or business in this city was square, with thick walls made from a mixture of clay, sand, <a href="lexicon.html#waterstones">waterstones</a> and dried grasses. They were constructed in a way that they kept the inhabitants cool
  in the day, and warm at night. A large building sat at one end of the grand plaza, also a square, but with smaller ones ajdjoined to it. A symbol was engraved into the front, the <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> insignia, also
  present on the face of every coin. This building, was likely the residence of someone important.
</p>
<p>
  A large structure sat in the middle of the plaza, a thick beam with a large wheel around it, spinning slowly. Eka then noticed that the beam and wheel were connected to a much larger cog, built under the plaza. Following one of these long
  branches Eka arrived into a bakery, inside another of these large beams came out of a hole in the floor, and it, had a series of smaller branches and cogs attached to it leading all the way to a flour mill.
</p>
<p>"Whoa-" Eka said, grinning widely. "This is brilliant!" The city was build on top of a huge cog, used to power devices in the businesses of the city.</p>
<p>In the bakery, the 'beam' had a movable arm that could be repositioned to another location to power different items like the mill, the flour mixer and the dough beater.</p>
<p>
  "You shouldn't mill so much <a href="lexicon.html#muckwheat">muckwheat</a>!" An old <a href="lexicon.html#aodal">Aodal</a> said to another, likely the owner of the bakery, "we sell so little now, no one wants any! Why waste it?"
</p>
<p>The bakery owner sighed at these words, and glanced over at fresh loaf of muckwheat bread, "people in this town need to be reminded of what real food looks like, and smells like!"</p>
<p>"They're going to shut us down Avril. We need coin to keep this place in operation."</p>
<p>
  Eka overheard this conversation, and was rather sad to hear it. This was a direct result of the increasing production of <a href="lexicon.html#foodstamps">foodstamps</a>. Eka carried these words back to Lupin, who had somehow gotten
  dragged into a <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> tour group. Leaving it was hard, everyone kept pushing them from one place to another, like a shepard herding sheplings.
</p>
<p>
  "The town operates on a schedule!" A tour guide to the city said to a group of newly-arrived visitors. "3 times a day, during rush hour, the strongest in the city come to the main beam in the plaza and give the master cog a big boost by
  spinning it faster manually! Food stamp production increases dramatically during these times, to meet the increase in demand. Outside of rush hour, the cog spins at a continuous and consistent speed, made possible by the outer cog that is
  built on top of the city wall. The outer cog is equipped with sails, using the power of the wind to keep moving all day everyday! But remember, currently <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> is trying to build a new systemt that would
  remove the need for the cog system entirely! Imagine!"
</p>
<p>
  Lupin and Eka began to tour the city like this, following the guide, they found their way into a factory that makes sweet-tasting <a href="lexicon.html#foodpatches">foodpatches</a>. On arrival every one was given a sample, the guide gave
  Eka a '<a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cake' patch. "It's just like having the real thing! Try it!"
</p>
<p>Eka smelled the patch, but did not dare to apply it to the skin, remembering what <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a> had said about them not being a substitute for real food.</p>
<p>"Our grand leader <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> had the idea for this wonderful product! It has saved countless lives, and propelled this city to fame!"</p>
<p>"<a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>?" Lupin said, loud enough for others to hear.</p>
<p>The entire group turned to look at the Verido, "you mean to say you don't know the grand leader's name?" One of the tourists asked, clearly upset by this.</p>
<p>"Oh — well I was kidding, of course I know!"</p>
<p>"Smooth." Eka whispered.</p>
<p>"Yea? Then when's <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> day hmm?!"</p>
<p>All eyes were on Lupin then, waiting for an answer to this supposedly obvious question.</p>
<p>"Um. Today?" Lupin said, tentatively, tipped off by the decorations in both the town and the factory.</p>
<p>The group then relaxed, all smiles. "That's right! Today is <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> day, celebrating the <a href="lexicon.html#greenday">Green Day</a> of our grand leader!"</p>
<p>Lupin was eager to get away from this group of zealots. As soon as the tour group made their way to the gift shop the Verido and Eka snuck out.</p>
<p>"I'd like to give this <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> a piece of my mind," Lupin said, not impressed with the factory.</p>
<p>
  Just when Lupin said this a horn sounded out, the plaza was filled with people, gathered around a small platform that had been erected over the central beam of the cog, causing it to spin. A short creature climbed up a ladder built into
  the side of the beam, and went to stand on the platform, because it turned, this enabled the speaker to address everyone from whatever direction at the same time. This, Dot had said, makes everyone feel important.
</p>
<p>
  "<a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>! <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>!" Everyone shouted, and this got Lupin's attention. The character standing on the little platform was a <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a>, bald, and
  wearing a striped jacket and pants. "<a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> loves you all, and thanks you for your hard work! <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> couldn't be as great as it is without your help!"
</p>
<p>
  The crowd cheered at these words, this <a href="lexicon.html#finiku">Finiku</a> wasn't <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>, but a representative that everyone around was referring to as 'Dot'. "Production of
  <a href="lexicon.html#foodstamps">foodstamps</a> is at an all-time high!" The crowd cheered again, as Dot began to list their yearly accomplishments aloud; from the amount of methane produced and processed by the
  <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>s, to the gradual adoption and acceptance of coin as a token of exchange outside of <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>.
</p>
<p>Lupin pulled out one of those 'coins' out from a side pocket, Eka spotted the coin then. "How did you get this?"</p>
<p>"Gree gave it to me, don't know what to do with it though. I can't say I like the idea of it. My spirit doesn't feel elevated at all."</p>
<p>
  Eka smirked, grabbed the coin from Lupin's hand and then disappeared into the crowd. "Eka? EKA! What are you - ah, never mind. I'll just wait here- alone." Moments after Eka left, Lupin's eyes found a familiar face in the crowd,
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>. The <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> was sitting on a crate. Lupin rushed over. "<a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>! Hey you forgot to meet us to—", the Verido stopped talking, noticing that
  like the other <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>'s in the line outside of town yesterday, <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> too, was high on kavava.
</p>
<p>"Oh hey Loopy!" <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> said, smirking.</p>
<p>"You didn't—" Lupin said, knowing full well that <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> had no coin to purchase kavava.</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> looked at the Verido with red eyes, the faint scent of the plant in the air around them. The <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> had been happy, comfortably cocooned into a kavava bubble; but now,
  seeing Lupin there, disappointed, caused the bubble to burst. Hands came to cover <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>'s face. "I didn't even taste it. I'm so weak."
</p>
<p>
  Lupin went to sit down on that same crate, shoulder to shoulder with <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>. Both said nothing, sitting together with Dot's voice in the background. Just then the woth returned, carrying a bit of
  <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> peel around, what it was able to salvage from the rooftop. Lupin grabbed the peel, and handed it over to <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>. "You can taste it now."
</p>
<p>The <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> pushed it away. "No, I don't like how it makes me feel. I'd rather forget."</p>
<p>
  A curious onlooker noticed the <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> peel. "THE <a href="lexicon.html#norange">NORANGE</a>!" Word of the <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> on the rooftop had traveled, everyone in town knew of
  it. Dot stopped speaking then, words falling on deaf ears as a crowd gathered around Lupin, as if drawn to the word itself. There was no way to run this time, guards arrived, one of them recognizing both Lupin and the
  <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> from before. "You two...!"
</p>
<p>
  The guard gripped Lupin's arm, then began to search for the piece of ID. "What? No ID either?! We've got a <a href="lexicon.html#specter">Specter</a> here!" The guard didn't even bother to check <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> for
  one.
</p>
<p>
  "HEY I've got ID! I exist! See? SEE?" <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> yelled, fumbling around for it, but the guard didn't want to hear it and both were dragged away from the crowds, across the plaza and into the square building with
  the <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> insignia. They were brought into the inner courtyard, and were asked to stay there.
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> gave Lupin a shove. "Why'd you have to get me involved?!"</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything! Everyone here just gets real crazy whenever there's mention of <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>s! How was I to know?!"</p>
<p>"You can't just go flaunting that stuff around!"</p>
<p>"I was NOT flaunting."</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> realized something then. "That's how you got into the city."</p>
<p>Lupin smirked. "Another accident."</p>
<p>"They're going to put us into a mill and grind us into <a href="lexicon.html#foodstamps">foodstamps</a>! That's what's gonna happen!" <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> yelled.</p>
<p>"Its your fault, you were supposed to meet us but instead you went on a kavava bender!"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> began to fight Lupin in the courtyard, although the fight occurred mostly on one side and less so on the other. The Verido didn't know how to fight, and made a dance of it, avoiding the onslaught of
  fists with ease given the fact that <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> was still high on root juices. Their fight was interrupted by Averet, the guard. "HEY stop that!" <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> instructed them to follow,
  and brought them in front of a large door, made of carved <a href="lexicon.html#banabo">banabo</a>.
</p>
<p>"Who does this belong to?" <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> then asked the two, holding a piece of <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> peel.</p>
<p>
  Lupin didn't want to put a claim to it, having no desire to get ground up into anything. <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> addressed the guard then. "How would I have a <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>, I was born here and
  never left, same as you."
</p>
<p>The guard gripped Lupin's arm then. "Right. Come with me <a href="lexicon.html#specter">Specter</a>."</p>
<p>"I bet the food stamp version of you will be DISGUSTING!" <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> shouted, just as another guard arrived to escort the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> outside.</p>
<p>
  Lupin gulped as the large <a href="lexicon.html#banabo">banabo</a> door opened, revealing a thick blind, obscuring both the room and its occupant. "Go," Averet said, pushing the captive onward. Lupin took a few stepsd forward, stopping a
  the draping, then hands found an opening in the fabric and the Verido pushed on. A young <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>, dressed in a green robe was on the other side. "You're the <a href="lexicon.html#specter">Specter</a>, the
  <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> smuggler?"
</p>
<p>"<a href="lexicon.html#specter">Specter</a> I get, but smuggler? That's escalating things a bit don't you think?"</p>
<p>
  "Follow me," the young <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> said then, pushing past yet another set of drapings, dividing the entrance to the rest of the room. After traversing the last set of fabric blinders, Lupin stepped into a
  cluttered, and messy room, filled with objects, most notably, it had plants! There was a gap in the ceiling, with a roof to shield it from the sun, but high enough to bring some light into the room.
</p>
<p>"The <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> thief is here."</p>
<p>"Now wait a minute—" Lupin began.</p>
<p>
  Another <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> pushed out from under a pile of documents, an older one with greying hair and a thin young face. This was <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>. <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> wore a
  simple pair of pants, not bothering to wear a shirt. This <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> did not bear the look of a grand leader.
</p>
<p>"Where did you get it?" <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> asked, nonchalantly, while checking over the leaves of a nearby plant.</p>
<p>"I think that if I did say, I'd betray a friend and put many other lives in danger."</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>'s ears perked at this. "Um, you're talking about <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a>."</p>
<p>Lupin nodded.</p>
<p>
  "Didn't think that grouch was alive, has had many <a href="lexicon.html#greenday">Green Day</a>s, too many some would say. I'm happy <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a> was able to save some
  <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> seeds," <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> said, switching attention to another plant, "<a href="lexicon.html#norcorn">norcorn</a> patties just aren't the same without
  <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> sauce."
</p>
<p>"Hope you don't me saying but... are you really <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>? The leader of this city?"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>'s yellow eyes moved to Lupin then. "Not what you were expecting?"</p>
<p>
  "No, not at all... you've got all these plants, feeding people <a href="lexicon.html#foodpatches">foodpatches</a>, the <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> goons and their <a href="lexicon.html#sandfin">sandfin</a>s that spit out
  smoke- it's horrific! Hard to believe it comes from you."
</p>
<p>"You have a problem with innovation?" <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> asked.</p>
<p>"I've got a problem with pain, and misery." Lupin replied.</p>
<p>"The <a href="lexicon.html#foodpatches">foodpatches</a> helped feed the refugees during the <a href="lexicon.html#iridiraids">Iridi raids</a>."</p>
<p>"Did you know that <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> employees sell expired <a href="lexicon.html#foodpatches">foodpatches</a> to the hungry for coin?"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> thought about this for a moment. "And you're holding me responsible."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes I am."</p>
<p>"The misuse of my creations is really not my fault, I couldn't have imagined them using it for personal gain."</p>
<p>"People in this city aren't eating real food anymore! Everyone is obssessed with coin, a useless piece of metal! It's ridiculous!"</p>
<p>
  "Coin was supposed to be a way to simplify exchanges in the city, <a href="lexicon.html#dot">Dot</a> had other plans for it. It was really a good idea, but again... others have pushed the concept a bit too far. It's no one's fault,
  everyone is doing their best. Everyone is just trying to survive out here. To be honest, I just decided to stop having ideas."
</p>
<p>Lupin noted the amount of drawings and books scattered about, clearly <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> wasn't done having ideas. "You mean you decided to stop telling others about them."</p>
<p>
  "Yes, I suppose you're right. The giant cog was a good idea — it was my first, my best. Should have stopped there. It doesn't matter anyway, I heard <a href="lexicon.html#dot">Dot</a> was planning on removing the entire system to replace
  it with one powered by natural gas instead of wind... light and power in every home is the goal, the people of <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> have expressed interest in this already. People are willing to pay for energy.
  <a href="lexicon.html#beobug">Beobug</a> created this need for it — it's clever, really."
</p>
<p>"D'you ever tell anyone all this? That's it a bad idea? Maybe if they heard it from you they'd stop?"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> didnt seem to agree with this theory. "People have forgotten who I am, what I look like; for instance, if I were to go out there on the plaza right now, shouting my name for all to hear, they
  wouldn't believe I was <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>. Especially, as you suggest, if I were out there speaking against my own ideas. Heh- they'd lock me up, thinking I was there to tarnish the reputation of the great leader."
</p>
<p>Lupin took note of a painting on the backwall, it much resembled the portrait carved on the coin and it was true that it did not look like this version of <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>.</p>
<p>
  "My artist got carried away with the representation, thought I needed to look more imposing, more angular — it's why I'm here really, and that no one can see me. If they did, they'd throw me out... thinking I was a pretender. Staying
  here, at least I'm safe and free to think up ideas all day, everyday."
</p>
<p>"Yea. You're comfortable while people suffer."</p>
<p>"People are suffering all the time <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a> thief. I was wondering, how did you get <a href="lexicon.html#zucca">Zucca</a> to give you that fruit?"</p>
<p>
  Lupin bore a sad expression, eyes moving to the entrance. "If you want to know the full story you'll have to walk out of here with me. How about it? Making <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> day synonymous with the day of the grand
  reveal?"
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> smirked, "I would have really enjoyed hearing that story... for you to know, and me to wonder I suppose." Saying this, the grand leader continued to look after the plants in the room, checking the
  leaves for signs of malnutrition with much love and care, like a <a href="lexicon.html#leafhound">leafhound</a> would.
</p>
<p>"Why did you ask me here?"</p>
<p>"A Verido with a <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>, a <a href="lexicon.html#hyroo">hyroo</a> and a round-eared companion is a curious thing - wouldn't you have asked yourself in here?"</p>
<p>"I'll add that story to the pile, in exchange for you to tell the truth. It's a good one-" Lupin teased.</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a> seemed amused by this, but not amused enough. "Goodbye <a href="lexicon.html#specter">Specter</a>."</p>
<p>
  Lupin let out a deep sigh, there was nothing to do then but leave. The Verido glanced at the second hand. "What now? What happens to the ones who don't exist in the eyes of <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>? Do i get ground up
  into fodder?"
</p>
<p>
  The green-clad <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> laughed, "that story I made up has really gotten around! Ah well, if it helps keep people in line." With this, Lupin was escorted out of the building. "You need to leave the city,
  right this instant." <a href="lexicon.html#monty">Monty</a>'s second hand watched as Lupin stepped into the main plaza with a guard, making their way towards the main gate. The guard kept close, to make sure the wrongdoer didn't decide to
  take a detour on the way out. <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> did see the Verido, but said nothing. There was nothing to say.
</p>
<p>Eka stood by <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>, chewing loudly, eating chunks of freshly baked <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cake. "D'you know where I can get some meppermint tea around here?"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> looked over, catching scent of the bread. "No, I don't know."</p>
<p>
  "You want some?" Eka offered, putting a slice of bread under the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>'s nose. "I could eat it all myself, but that would make me a glutton. You eating a bit would make me feel like less of one. At least
  I'll be a generous glutton you know? That sounds better somehow."
</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> was hungry, having forgotten to buy some <a href="lexicon.html#foodpatches">foodpatches</a>. "Sure, more for you than me though." <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> chewed on the piece of bread, the
  taste of it was like an explosion of flavor! The effect was so strong that the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a>'s body began to shiver uncontrollably. "There's gingin in it... I love gingin! Well -I used to."
</p>
<p>
  "Enjoy it, this is likely the last bread the bakery will ever bake. It's closing tomorrow, not enough people buying bread... shame. They make amazing pastries too — Avril and Ira i mean, they're the real deal! Soon they'll be gone.
  Extinct, like the <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>s."
</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> stopped chewing, saddened by this conversation; this was usually the point where the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> would start ingesting some mind-numbing kavava.</p>
<p>
  "Oh! Now i remember-" Eka began, "Avril's grandmapa Moki was the one making the mepperpint tea! Had a garden outside, it was a popular place back in the day. Some <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> was working there too — name was
  Azul i think, was the only one who really understood mepperpint. I miss it, but you know, if you drink too much of it-'
</p>
<p>"—It makes your eyes sprout leaves," <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> finished, smiling faintly.</p>
<p>Eka nodded. "Exactly! Alright. Well, have some more bread. I'm going to go for a walk now."</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> stood there, a giant slice of <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> bread in hand, and eyes moving over to that bakery; for some reason, <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> had forgotten it existed, lost
  in a perpetual kavava daze. Now, it's like the fog had cleared, and the world had much more detail in it; the smells were stronger and the the sound of the world was like music. Without a moment's hesitation, and drawn by the smell of
  muckwheat, the <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> walked to the bakery and went inside.
</p>
<p>Lupin was outside of the city, sitting in their tent and waiting for Eka's return. <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> was there, conversing with the woth, listening to a re-telling of today's events.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eka arrived before nightfall, finding Lupin in the tent still; but there was something different, something unusual...</p>
<p>"You've got a cup on your head, you know that right?" Eka asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"It's a thinking cup," Lupin said, with a sigh, knowing all-to-well how ridiculous it was.</p>
<p>"Wow! Is it working? Are you having some great thoughts right now?"</p>
<p>Lupin removed the cup then, staring into it. "No — Maybe it's because there's no tea in it."</p>
<p>Eka presented a slice of <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> bread to the downtrodden Verido. "Did not find meppermint tea, but this bread stands well enough on its own. Try it."</p>
<p>"Mission failed," Lupin said.</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"On getting some <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cake and mepperpint tea."</p>
<p>"No, I think our excursion into <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a> was a success! We learned many things today, made friends too!"</p>
<p>"Friends? Everyone here thinks I'm a fiend. Did you not see my walk of shame?"</p>
<p>"You've learned more of the world Lupin, and with this you are wiser."</p>
<p>"I was hoping we could help somebody..."</p>
<p>Eka went to hug Lupin then, "is that what you think we're doing? Helping others?"</p>
<p>"Yes? Maybe? I don't know."</p>
<p>"We came here for cake and tea Lew."</p>
<p>
  "Yea. Yea you're right," saying this, Lupin took a bit of the <a href="lexicon.html#bam">bam</a> cake, "Ooooh wow — this is so good!" The woth moved out of its glass house then, eager to get a bite of this famed pastry, even
  <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> was intrigued. "I'm not sharing, sorry!" Lupin said, but both creatures leapt towards the Verido then, eager to get some of the remaining chunk of bread. Lupin was pinned to the floor, with
  <a href="lexicon.html#hush">Hush</a> chewing on the bread and the woth eating stray crumbs off its snout. "This is like the <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>s episode all over again!"
</p>
<p>
  The next day, the gang packed up their tent and gear and left the city of <a href="lexicon.html#montore">Montore</a>. Their experience there wasn't ideal, but as Eka had said, they had learned a thing, and learning a thing a day is what's
  most important.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Unbeknownst to them, a small revolution was going on in the city; <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> had sold the last of the kavava in exchange for coin to pay for more bread at the bakery. This sell, helped to convince Ira to keep the
  bakery open, at least for another day or two.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="lexicon.html#terin">Terin</a> went to say hello to <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> that day, they'd grown up together, and while their lives had taken different turns they were still friendly to each other — most
  times.
</p>
<p>"Hey <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>, keeping out of trouble today I hope," <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> said.</p>
<p>"Yea. Keeping the peace, in my own way."</p>
<p>There was a pause between them then, but the <a href="lexicon.html#aodal">Aodal</a> spoke again, "d'you know where I can get some <a href="lexicon.html#norcorn">norcorn</a> patties around here?"</p>
<p>"I'd ask Avril's bakery."</p>
<p>"Bakery?"</p>
<p><a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a> pointed to it. "Yea, it's where I got this bread. You want to try some?"</p>
<p>
  <a href="lexicon.html#averet">Averet</a> grabbed a slice of bread and started to eat it, "oh — OH! This is good...! It's so moist! Why do I never buy real bread anyway?" The bread disappeared, consummed within seconds. "Thanks for that
  <a href="lexicon.html#kuzi">Kuzi</a>, I'll drop by to see Avril later to ask about the <a href="lexicon.html#norcorn">norcorn</a> — you see, I've got this piece of <a href="lexicon.html#norange">norange</a>..."
</p>
