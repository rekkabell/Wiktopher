Using this technique can aid to prevent dehydration, especially when traveling long distances in the desert.</p><p>The water stones are found in pockets of air underground, some wells may carry as much as thousand stones or as little as a hundred. Waterlillies are used to locate the wells, they typically grow overtop of such sites in great numbers.</p><p>Is it thought that the planet originally had no water, and that it came via sky rocks. There are 4 craters: the Lorana crater, the Toko crater, the Norlok crater and the Ratus crater. All of these were once basins full of water. Overtime, the water receded into the soil and began to pearl, a result of the composition of the sand on the planet, which helped to form a hard membrane. Because the planet is mostly sand dunes, some of the craters were partially filled.</p>
  <p>Waterstones also double as a way to transport and preserve water for a long long time. The water inside of the membrane is perfectly preserved, and is not affected by the sun. It expands in the warmth and shrinks in the cold.</p>

  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>VOLARE = Fa(.___) Do(___) Re(._.)<br /></p>
  <p>VO V(.___) O(Fa)</p>
  <h4>Using Silent Consonants</h4>
  <p>
    To create single vowel sounds or words, the syllable is sounded by sliding from <i>Si</i>, toward the target vowel. For instance, to make the sound O, or Ho, the sound will be that of a sliding tone from <i>Si</i> to <i>Fa</i>.
